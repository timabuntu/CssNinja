And what that challenge is,\n\nis to,\n\nyou're going to take the files that are\navailable for download and there's some\n\nissues in there.\n\nSo the first thing is the text is gonna\nbe going all the way across and we're\n\ngonna want to limit it to\nthe midpoint right here.\n\nAnd the other thing is when\nyou make the screen smaller,\n\nthe text is going to\noverflow at the bottom,\n\nand you're gonna want to fix that as\nwell and make it look a little bit more\n\nlike what you see here.\nSo this is the end result.\n\nThis is where we want to get\nit to. So take your time.\n\nIt's just a refresher on all the\nthings that we've already looked at,\n\nbut you might be going, Kevin, I\nknow this, I can do it in my head.\n\nIf it's that easy to do, it's not\ngoing to take you long to do it.\n\nTake the time to open up your editor,\n\ntake the time to make\nsure you're able to do it.\n\nLook at the code that I've given.\nYou make sure that it works.\n\nMake sure you're there. Uh, cause you\nknow, a lot of times people will say,\n\nI know how to do that. That's how you\nget stuck in things like tutorial hell,\n\nwhere you just watch lots of things.\nYou, you understand what's happening.\n\nBut then when you go to do\nit yourself, you get stuck.\n\nI want you to make sure you go and\ndo it. If you're able to do it,\n\nthat's amazing. That's awesome.\n\nBut if you do get stuck at\nanything or anything along the way,\n\nthat's completely fine too.\n\nYou could either go back in the previous\nlessons and see how I did it there and\n\nthen fix it here or you can move on.\n\nBut if you do end up listening to\nwhat I did, if you do get stuck,\n\nwhat I want you to do is then go and fix\nyour own file and make sure you really\n\ndo understand it before\nmoving on to the next lesson.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/233004-day-1-using-percentages-avoiding-heights/678674-challenge-1?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_241">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wd8qzq7bf9","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M54S","name":"01-6.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/aa5c6500ef273ec21500138bd7accfd34ec9632a.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/fb22c12754216038227cbe68072fdc86b6da962c.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wd8qzq7bf9","uploadDate":"2020-06-29","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"We've got to lay it, looking like this,\nbut there's one big issue with that.\n\nAnd that is when we get\nthem to bigger screen sizes,\n\nit just keeps going and going and going.\nAnd it looks a little bit weird. Um,\n\nand we, when I say weird,\nit's generally speaking,\n\nwe want to limit total\nline lens and, you know,\n\ntech starts stretching all the way across.\n\nAnd this is actually one of the biggest\nmistakes that I see developers make,\n\nwho don't know a lot about design and\nit's that they let things go from one side\n\nof the screen all the way over the other.\n\nAnd it makes her a really\nawkward experiences.\n\nGo look at how other websites are\ndesigned professionally designed websites.\n\nAnd you'll notice that the usually\nlimit the total size that things get to.\n\nAnd it's just because the way our\neye naturally reads texts and the,\n\nwhere we are and what\nwe've been conditioned to,\n\nwe don't like things where we have to\nliterally move her head to read across the\n\npage. Now it's not an issue\nwhen we're on small designs,\n\nbut it is an issue when we\nget to these big screen sizes.\n\nLuckily there is a way to fix it.\nThat is really, really simple.\n\nAnd it goes back a little bit to the\ntypes of things that we have already been\n\ndoing in a way, but it's\ninstead of setting a width,\n\nbecause remember when we set a\nset width that creates an issue,\n\nit lets it create side scrolling.\nIf we drop below that width.\n\nSo we always want to set a\nwidth using a percentage,\n\nbut if you have a maximum\nsize that you want,\n\nwe have our max width\nproperty that we can use.\n\nAnd let's say we wanted a\nmax width and for simplicity,\n\nlet's just stick with pixels for now.\nAnd we'll do 750 pixels as a max width.\n\nSo when I come and take a look\nright now, nothing has changed.\n\nIt looks exactly the same.\nAnd when I make this smaller,\n\nit's still going to be exactly the same.\n\nLiterally nothing has changed in what\nwe've created so far. When we go smaller,\n\neverything is still getting smaller. But\nwhen I make this bigger, at one point,\n\nwe're going to see it's\ngoing to stop growing.\n\nEven though my viewport is getting\nbigger and bigger and bigger,\n\nbecause it has an idea with an 80%.\n\nSo it wants to be 80% of the viewport\nat all sizes. So that's what it's doing.\n\nExcept now we've said it cannot\nget bigger than 750 pixels.\n\nSo it's 80%,\n\nas long as it's 750 pixels or\nsmaller, it will never get above that.\n\nAnd you might have also seen\nthat there's a men with property.\n\nAnd there are times once again,\nand nothing I say is set in stone.\n\nThere's no rule. Uh, but in general, we\nwant to avoid Heights. And in general,\n\nhaving something like a minimum width,\nif you have a good reason for it,\n\nthat's fine. But most of the\ntime it's like setting a width.\n\nIt's going to fight against\nthings being responsive.\n\nIt's not going to make it easier\nfor something to be responsive.\n\nSo by setting a max with\nand dealing with max width,\n\nit lets you design for your big screen,\nwithout things stretching from one side,\n\nall the way to the other it's limits the\nspace we're working in makes for a more\n\npleasant design and more pleasant\nexperience for the viewer.\n\nBut we still keep our responsiveness\nwhere things can shrink down.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/254267-day-3-enter-max-width/678811-adding-in-a-max-width?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_294">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/1w1yjogksv","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT1M16S","name":"01-7.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/b4b0e4e5326bd9b58595299765609629377eb5f9.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/b7af1b9483ab1c21586d7ea64286ae797bc202d1.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/1w1yjogksv","uploadDate":"2020-06-29","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So I have another challenge for you and\nit's to take everything we've learned so\n\nfar, and also to push\nyou a little bit, uh,\n\nto see how you can be thinking about\nresponsive layouts and what we're doing in\n\nthis one is starting you off here.\nThis is what we have right now.\n\nWe have more content\ndown here this time.

So let's look at the solution.\nSo in the markup, as we already see,\n\nwe have a container here. We\nhave a div with an intro content,\n\nand then we have the text\nthat is inside of that.\n\nSo when we come over here and we\ntake a look at what that looks like,\n\nwe have our container, that's giving\nus all of the properties there.\n\nSo the very first thing I'm going to do\nis it's limit the total size of my intro\n\ncontent, income dot intro content.\n\nAnd we want to give that a width of 50%,\n\njust like we did in the earlier lessons.\n\nWe're looking at how we can limit the\nsize of each child. So there we go.\n\nNow this is really common type of thing.\n\nYou might have a big background image\nhere instead of a solid color on your big\n\nhero element with a button.\nAnd you're pretty much done.\n\nThat's a very common type\nof thing that you might do.\n\nAnd then here on the container, we have\nanother issue because if I go too small,\n\nwe lose the text out the bottom. So we\nsaw that instead of setting a height,\n\nwe just want to use our padding.\nIf you did it just like that,\n\nand you lifted it to him,\nthat's perfectly fine. We bring,\n\nwe eliminate the issue that\nwe caused because once again,\n\nit's us who caused it in\nthe CSS. And so there we go.\n\nWe can see that we can now grow and\nshrink that nice and easily everything is\n\nworking. If you pumped up the\nsize of the padding a little bit,\n\njust to accommodate that, that would be\ncompletely fine, but aren't necessary,\n\nbut I'm going to do that just\nbecause why not?

I have at this opened,\n\nwhich is just my browser window and I\nhave my index study HTML style that CSS,\n\nyour ad that I am going to be,\nyou know they're completely blank.\n\nSo we're starting from scratch\nnow. If you are in a vs code,\n\nwe knew it was actually just put a,\n\nan explanation point and the push tab and\nwe'll have all the code we need to get\n\nstarted. The basic boiler plate here,\n\nif you're using something\nelse other than vs code,\n\nwhat I just did is called Emmet.\nAnd if you want to get Emmet,\n\nthere's a lot of really awesome things\nthat makes your life so much easier.\n\nI'd encourage you to check it out.\nSo I'll put a link to it down below.\n\nBut whichever editor you're using,\n\nthere's usually an extension you can\nget to install it into the editor.\n\nBut again, on vs code, it\nis in there by default.\n\nSo if we're looking at our design,\n\nwe know we want to have this background\nthat stretches from one side to the\n\nSo for now I'm just going to put that in\na div and I'm going to give that div a\n\nclass just because I like working with\nclasses no matter what I'm doing. Um,\n\nyou know, this could be something else.\nIt could be a section, um, or whatever.\n\nBut we don't really have much\ncontext for it right now.\n\nSo I'm just going to put it in a div and\nI would call it my hero section cause\n\nthat's typically what these big areas,\n\na lot of times they'll have an image here\nand we're going to be getting there in\n\nthis week. We're going to be doing\njust that and adding an image in,\n\nhaving two columns and adding\nmore stuff down below. Okay. Um,\n\nso this is sort of my hero\nsection at the top of the page.\n\nYou gave this a different name, by\nall means. It really doesn't matter,\n\nbut this is what's going to have the\nbackground color on it. Then in here,\n\nlet's give this in each\none and a paragraph.\n\nSo what I'm doing is I'm just putting\nthe letter P and then I am pushing tabs.\n\nSo that is the Emmet thing that I just\ntalked about that is going to make that\n\nautomatically all appear when\nI do just that. My h1, My P.\n\nand then down here I'm\ngoing to put an a dot BTN.\n\nSo it's going to be a link with the\nclass of BTN on it. So when I push tab,\n\nyou can see I have that right there.\n\nI'm going to give this just a hashtag\nfor now because I don't actually have\n\nanywhere for it to go at the\nmoment. And I want to learn,\n\nI'm just going to speed this up life\nthrough all the texts in here for you.\n\nAnd there we go. The text is\nall in place. Um, so if I,\n\nI'm just going to turn off word wrap for\na second and we can see I have my big\n\nhero div inside there. I have\nmy H one, I to hit a cut there.\n\nUh, so I, my H one that's right there.\n\nAnd then my paragraph of text followed\nhere by my button right underneath.\n\nThat's what word wrapped back on cause I\njust find it makes it look a little bit\n\ncleaner. Now one thing I didn't do is\nI put this big dark background on it,\n\nbut let's actually go ahead and do this\nand maybe you've spotted the mistake\n\nthat I've made already and I a few did.\nThat's really, really awesome. Okay. Um,\n\nbut we, anyway, we'll get to\nwhat the mistake was in a second.\n\nIt's something that I often\ndo. So we have my dot hero.\n\nLet's start with right away,\nthe background color on\nthat, which was two, three,\n\nfour to four a and we had our\ncolor, which was nice and easy.\n\nIt's FFF or white and we hit\nsave and we should see, Oh,\n\nI haven't put my server on right\nnow, so I'm just going to click,\n\ngo live there and we should see\nsome of this come up up here.\n\nThe refresh the first\ntime. There we go. Um,\n\nwe can see everything popping in\nthere and it is starting to work.\n\nSo that's awesome. Uh, except my CSS\nisn't working. I must've not linked it.\n\nI didn't. So let's go and do that.\n\nSo one thing that the boilerplate\ndoesn't do is that, so let's do a link.\n\nAnd my interrupt here is a\nstyle dot CSS. Ah, there we go.\n\nMuch, much better. So we can see\nthat we have that all coming in.\n\nNow if you remember one thing that I\nsaid last week is that all websites are\n\nperfectly responsive.\n\nSo don't forget you have made\na responsive website right now.\n\nEverything is working, but it\ndoesn't look very nice at all.\n\nSo let's come back to my style. And\nthere's two things that I always put, uh,\n\nat the beginning of every file. Okay.\n\nWhich is my star star before and we're\nnot going to be getting into pseudo\n\nelements, but um, start after it\nis a good habit I find to do it.\n\nSo if ever you do have pseudo elements,\nthis doesn't cause any issues.\n\nAnd we do a box sizing order box right\nthere. If you don't know what this does.\n\nI'm going to put a link in the description\nof this lesson to one of my YouTube\n\nvideos that explains it. It's a really\nshort video and it is worth knowing,\n\nbut I don't want to talk about it right\nnow because it's a little bit out of\n\ncontext to what we're learning about and\nit just makes our lives so much easier.\n\nAnd the last thing for now is on\nmy body we can put a margin zero.\n\nThere we go. That's already\nlooking a little bit better. Uh,\n\non my hero here we can add some padding.\n\nI want to get into one of\nthe really common mistakes\nthat I see people make that\n\ncauses issues when they want\nto make responsive websites.\n\nSo here what I'm going to do is padding\nand I'm just going to put like 200\n\npixels. Oh.\n\nAnd the problem is what happens\nis, or maybe 200 is kind of big,\n\nlet's drop that down to 100\n\nwe do something like that and\nit looks quite a lot like this.\n\nThe spacings may be still a little\nbit bigger than what I put here,\n\nbut at this screen size, these two start\nmatching each other and you're going,\n\nhuh, Hey, I'm doing pretty\ngood. I've got all of that.\n\nI just need to figure out a way to limit\nthe total size of this and I'm going to\n\nbe off and running, but we're going\nto run into an issue with that.\n\nAnd one of the issues is when\nyou get to smaller screen sizes,\n\na padding of a hundred on both\nsides can be really, really big.\n\nSo let's go down to the iPhone six\nsize here and it is getting, you know,\n\nfor the amount of content I have,\nthat's a lot of spoiled space.\n\nI'm a big fan of white space. I think\nwhite space is the greatest thing,\n\nbut that's getting way too big.\n\nAnd if we're on a larger\nscreen size and we do this,\n\nwe get this thing where it's going to\nstretch all the way and it sort of moves\n\nover. But a lot of times we\nwant that content centered.\n\nSo instead of setting some\npadding on the left and the right,\n\nthis is why we are looking at um,\n\nsetting up with our a container when we\nwere looking at that last video. Right.\n\nso what I'm going to do with my Patty\nhere is a hundred pixels top and bottom,\n\nand then we can say zero left and right,\n\nwhich is going to stick it\nto the sides. And that's, no,\n\nit doesn't look nice right now,\n\nbut it is one of the mistakes that I said\nI made because here ideally you'd have\n\nsomething like U container,\nyou called it a wrapper,\n\nyou can call it something else.\n\nThere's many different\nnames for this type of div.\n\nIt all end up doing the same type\nof thing. So just like that. So I,\n\nmy hero than in my hero, I have my\ncontainer, each one paragraph and my link.\n\nSo here on my container\nI can set the width,\n\nyou say 80% we can set this to have\na margin of zero auto and hit save.\n\nSo now we sort of get that\nsame idea that we just had,\n\nbut we can see that at small screen\nsizes because it's at 80% it's shrinking\n\ndown. So that area is getting\nsmaller, which is really,\n\nreally handy and really nice. And\nwhen we get to bigger screen sizes,\n\nit already is going to be a little bit\nresponsive because that space is going to\n\nkeep growing and growing and growing.\n\nBut it's not really gonna do its job at\none point. This is going to get too big.\n\nIt's going to go too far across.\nSo that is, if you remember,\n\nwe didn't cover too\nmuch material last week.\n\nSo this is also where [inaudible] we\ncan put in a max width and the max with\n\npier is when you can start\nusing actual fixed values.\n\nSay we come into this with\nthe max width of, I dunno,\n\nwe'll say 750 pixels and now we\nhave something that's working.\n\nOh\n\nit can grow and it can shrink.\n\nBut when we get to that maximum with the\n750 it stops in the middle there and it\n\nstops growing. And you know, why\ndon't we even put this for fun,\n\na border on here so we can\nreally see it in action.\n\nTwo pixels solid yellow\nshould show up really well.\n\nWe can see that it's staying\nsmall and then when we grow,\n\nit's locking and it's stopping at\nthat spot, which is just perfect.\n\nIt's exactly what we want it to do.\nWe turn off that max width again,\n\nyou can see that it just keeps\ngrowing and growing and growing.\n\nSo is that even though\nthe text is stopping here,\n\nwe're getting this issue of\nthat box going on forever.\n\nSo this just helps us\nlimit the total size of it.\n\nNow we still have one other issue\nthat we want to take care of.\n\nSo let's shrink this back down\nand that other issue is here.\n\nI don't want it to go all the way across.\n\nSo when I get to this size of screen here,\n\nlet's turn off that or we'll\nleave the border on. Now actually,\n\nI think it illustrate well\nwhat we want to do. Um,\n\nand maybe this could\nactually be a bit bigger.\n\nWe'll try and match a little bit more.\n\nWe have down here [inaudible] so something\nlike that I think would work a little\n\nbit better. Um, so if our\nscreen is going like that,\n\nwe can see here I want\na lot of empty space.\n\nI want to limit the\ntotal size we have there.\n\nWhereas right now it's\ngoing all the way across.\n\nAnd what you could definitely do here\nis you could do a hero and we called it\n\nintro last time intro hero. It's\ngoing to be the same thing. Um,\n\nbut so we did a hero paragraph.\n\nI could say that this has a width 50%\nand I could limit the size of that\n\nparagraph to 50% of this parent.\n\nSo remember whenever we set\nparents percentages on something,\n\nit's always of the parent of this 80%\nwas of the parent, which was our body,\n\nwhich was taking up the whole viewport\nwhereas this is 50% of that 80% so I\n\ncould do that.\n\nThen I'd have to do it for this\nelement and this one and this one.\n\nAnd then what would happen if\nI added a new element? Well,\n\nI'd have to add that into my CSS and\nwe'd have to add more and more and more.\n\nAnd that could, you know, potentially\nyou might get this from the designer,\n\nbut then they ended up adding more content\nand then it just starts becoming more\n\nand more of a fight. So on my hero P\nhere personally, instead of doing that,\n\nif I needed to limit this to something\nthat's a little bit narrower,\n\nI would come in here, Oh, if I space that\nout, um, I want to have a div here so,\n\nand it's going to be a diff called\nhero double underscore text.\n\nNow I'm assuming you didn't do the double\nunderscore and that's completely fine\n\nif that's the case. Um,\n\nthe reason I put a double\nunderscore there is, um,\n\nI'm a real big fan of the\nBEM naming convention.\n\nSo because this hero text is a sub\ncomponent of this hero section,\n\nwe'd double underscore to say that the\ntext is living inside of there. Um,\n\nso just as a quick reference to it,\nif it's not something you want to use,\n\nby no means do you have to\nfeel obligated to use it.\n\nIt's just a CSS naming\nconvention. Once again,\n\nI will leave a link down to the bottom.\nI'm on a bit more information on that,\n\non a bit more information on that if\nit's something that interests you. Um,\n\nso now we have my hero, my hero. So\nthat's setting my background color.\n\nIt's setting the text color and\nthat's it. I have my container,\n\nmy container is setting this yellow box\nright here to hold all of my content in\n\nthe middle. And now I\nhave my hero text here.\n\nNow this might seem like a lot of dibs\nfor something that's really simple. Yeah.\n\nAnd this is going to get a little bit\nmore complicated once we've added in our\n\nsecond element here and we're really\ngoing to need this div in that case.\n\nAnd I also find when we're thinking\nresponsively, the more organized we are,\n\nthe much easier it is to be able to\n[inaudible] control things the way we need\n\nto be able to control them.\n\nSo now we can do my hero\ndouble or underscore text\nand we can give that a width\n\nof 50% and we'll just give that a border\nof one pixel solid pink just so we can\n\nsee it right now. And you've got to\nsave both files when you do these.\n\nThere we go. So you can see the pink\nbox is coming up right in the middle.\n\nNow if you were trying to match\nthat as closely as possible,\n\nit is also possible at\nthis point you went,\n\nOh maybe it shouldn't be 50 it should\nbe 70 or 80 or whatever it is that you\n\ncame up with.\n\nMaybe we'll do a 60% on that and now\nwe can see it matches a little more.\n\nIf you weren't perfectly matched,\nhonestly, it is completely fine.\n\nI'm not lining up exactly\nwith what we have,\n\nbut I'm pretty happy with\nhow that is coming along.\n\nThe last thing I'm going\nto do is bring in my,\n\nwe have to do our button\nand we want to do our fonts.\n\nLet's start with the topography. I'm\ngoing to come up to my Google fonts here.\n\nI've already done a search for Roberto\nso I'm just going to click on that.\n\nI want to select my, uh,\n\nI think it was the regular\nand the black that I used.\n\nI might've used the regular bold\nthere but we'll just use too.\n\nI'll grab [inaudible] this\nembed link right there.\n\n[inaudible] in my HTML\nright before my own CSS.\n\nI'll plug about one in right there.\nNow if you're not used to Google fonts,\n\nall that is doing is linking it to it.\nSo it's making that font accessible.\n\nIt's making or it's making\nthat font something that I\ncan now use in my project.\n\nSo we want to come back to here and we\nwant to copy this one and we might as\n\nwell just put that on our body cause it's\nwhere what we're using throughout the\n\nwhole site and we're getting\npretty close to being done.\n\nMaybe it was actually the 300 I used\nfor that, but it is pretty close.\n\nSo let's come in and set some of that up.\nSo I've my each one and my paragraphs.\n\nSo any paragraph texts,\n\nI'm always gonna I'm not going\nto actually put it on my bodies.\n\nI'm going to put all of the stuff\nI need here. Um, so my font size,\n\nin this case it is 21 pixels.\n\nSo if you went to the FEMA file and you\nsaid 21 pixels, that is perfectly fine.\n\nUm, I personally prefer writing\nmy font sizes always in REM.\n\nUm, it is something that takes a little\nbit while to get used to. It's again,\n\noutside of the scope of this, I'm really\nfocusing on the layouts for this one,\n\nbut in general or by default,\n\nmost browsers will default\nto a font size of 16 pixels,\n\nwhich is equal to one REM.\n\nSo in this case to get to 21 it's\ngoing to be one point, it's like three,\n\none to five or something like\nthat. Rim, if you want around that.\n\nAnd to say it's 1.3. Okay. I don't\nthink anyone would get mad at you. Uh,\n\nso 1.3 remet let's go with that. It's\ngoing to boost that one up a little bit.\n\nAnd in this case, this one was 48 pixels.\n\nA 48 is much easier to do cause that\none's gonna be a font size of the rim and\n\nit gets a little bit bigger there.\n\nYou can see the lines are breaking\nin different spots here. Again,\n\nthis is really going to depend\non the screen size though.\n\nAnd we aren't worrying about responsive\nlayouts or max sewed at that size.\n\nI think here I was zoomed,\n\nI just zoomed in a little bit more and\nthis is more at 100% than what I was at.\n\nUm, if you're really worried,\n\nactually right now it looks\nlike I have side scrolling,\n\nbut we can shrink that down. There we\ngo. Um, we're worried about responsibly.\n\nIt's don't worry about where a\nsingle word line is breaking. Um,\n\nor else you're going to go\na little bit cuckoo. Um,\n\nbut you can play with these numbers if\nyou really wanted to match it perfectly.\n\nI did say to try your best, but\nI'm kinda happy with this again.\n\nLet's make this a little bit bigger\nand good enough to me again. Actually,\n\nthere we go. I think that's\nlooking okay. Uh, maybe this again,\n\nthis is at 60. I don't want to make\nthat more. Maybe the max width,\n\nwe could boost up a little\nbit if you really wanted to,\n\nto try and get it to um, break up\nmore lines. And I guess if I did that,\n\nI'd actually have to make\nit wider. So I don't know.\n\nSay we said 1100 pixels is a max\nwidth. Then boom, look at that.\n\nWe've sort of matched exactly\nwhat we had there, uh,\n\nor as close as we can get to it anyway.\n\nAnd now that's also turn\noff these borders. We don't\nreally need them anymore.\n\nUh, background [inaudible]\norder. We're getting there.\n\nWe just have our left to do.\n\nSo down here I'm going to do dot BTN\ncause that's the class name that we gave\n\nit. And on there I'm going to do a,\n\na display of inline block.\nNow if you didn't do this,\n\nit's not the end of the world, but\nI'll show you why I did it in a second.\n\nAnd we're also going to give this\na background color of [inaudible].\n\nThat right there, it's coming together.\nWe give it a little bit of padding. Uh,\n\nwe'll go with like a 0.25 M and maybe\n1.25 M on the left and the right,\n\nwe'll see what that looks like. Uh, we\nprobably need that a little bit bigger.\n\nUh, border, uh, border radius.\n\nIt will be a cool trick\nhere. If you did 50%,\n\nit makes like circles\nand generally speaking,\n\nwhat you want to do is you want to match\nthe height of this to get nice round\n\ncorners. But it's really hard to\nknow if you have a really big number,\n\nit's going to work every time.\n\nSo even if you just came in\nand said like a hundred pixels,\n\nit's going to work and give\nyou perfectly rounded corners.\n\nThe only time that's not going to do it\nis if it's smaller than what the total\n\nis. So we'll just go with a hundred.\n\nFor now and we know it's perfectly rounded\non the sides. So that's looking good.\n\nWe want to do some tech stuff. I tend to\nkeep things grouped together. So text,\n\ndecoration and none.\n\nAnd we also want [inaudible] a\ntext transform of upper case.\n\nIf we do both of those,\nit's getting closer.\n\nThe color of it itself is the same as\nour background color that we have right\n\nhere. So color and be that right there,\n\nthe font wait, we'll do\nthe 900 for the big bold.\n\nAnd as I said, I wanna change my\nspacing a little bit on there. Um,\n\nso my padding,\n\nI think we'll have to bring that up to\n8.5 and maybe even like a two and that\n\nmight even be a 0.75 that's\nlooking at not too bad. Um,\n\nI definitely use the bold and\nnot the black, but as I said,\n\nI only want to bring in two fonts, so I\nthink I'll leave it just like that. Um,\n\none thing I want is to\nincrease the spacing here.\n\nI could put a margin top on my button.\n\nI'm not going to do that though because\nI don't know necessarily if every time I\n\nhave a button, I mean in need a really\nbig space here. Now if you did that,\n\nit's 100% perfectly fine. I'm just\ntrying to think like big pictures.\n\nSay I was given this to start with,\n\nbut I knew that there would be more\nthings coming along in the future and I\n\nwanted to be as forward\nthinking as possible.\n\nI would probably maybe even add a class\nname to it or if I just did like my\n\nparagraph inside my hero\nas a margin, autumn,\n\nI'd say three M um, you'll probably\nget, you know, something like that.\n\nI'm here or I'm using em.\n\nThe M are always relative\nto the font size itself.\n\nSo in this case, three M. okay. Um,\n\nit's a little bit like REM that I used\nup top. So REM is always times 16.\n\nIn this case it's always a\nmultiplication of the font size.\n\nSo on my paragraph here,\nthe font size was 21 pixels,\n\nso that'd be 21 times three,\nwhich 63, I guess. Um,\n\nbut I was just estimating to be honest.\nI go, I know roughly my font size,\n\nI took a guess a little bit\nand it happened to work.\nSame with the padding here.\n\nThat means relative to this font size.\n\nSo the padding on this side and this side\nis going to be 16 times or not even 16\n\ntimes two. Um, it would\nbe the 21 times two.\n\nSo we have 42 pixels,\n\npretty much a padding on the\ntwo sides and then a 0.75,\n\nwhich I'm not going to do in my head\non the top and the bottom there.\n\nAnd just like that, I think that\nuh, we're pretty much done for that.\n\nWe could um, if you want,\ndefinitely bring in a [inaudible],\n\na hover and a dot.\n\nA button focus state on these, uh,\n\nwhich we could do.\n\nWe could change the colors a little bit\nor even just say like opacity becomes\n\nlike 0.75 or something.\n\nJust something that makes it obvious\nwhen Ron it and I do a focus.\n\nSo if I tab on, we can also\nsee that it is being selected.\n\nNow I am a big fan of making\nfocus styles. Stand out more.\n\nIf that's something you'd like to learn\nmore about. Uh, you could definitely,\n\nI just realized I had this way\noff screen for a little bit there,\n\nbut it's definitely something that\nyou could, uh, dive more into.\n\nif you want to include the link to that\nvideo down below so you can check that\n\nout. I hope you had success with this\nchallenge because now we're going to start\n\ngetting a little bit more interesting\nby bringing Flexbox into all of it.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/259297-day-7-solution-to-challenge-3/747090-my-solution-to-challenge-3?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_668">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/94ki12g6cq","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT9M31S","name":"02-01-flex-intro_1.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/92ea8be2eff892174ee279b06f3651caf8d568ff.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/e162f28e2e848844f8415ed5b7d6d354d53830f3.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/94ki12g6cq","uploadDate":"2020-04-19","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"All right, so you were back in our\nlayout here as you might notice,\n\nbut there's a little change and you can\nsee I've added a bit of content and this\n\nis what we're going to be focusing\non for the next little bit.\n\nAnd as you might be able to guess\nfrom the class names that I put here,\n\nwe're going to be creating columns.\nIf you've ever used bootstrap,\n\nyou might also recognize the naming\nconvention that I'm using here.\n\nHaving a container with a row and\na column. I am in a future video,\n\nwe're going to look at a way we can do\naway with having a row and not having and\n\nhaving like an optional\ncontainer for having, uh,\n\njust because I do think sometimes it's a\nlittle bit of extra markup for nothing.\n\nBut, uh,\n\nfor now I'm going to keep with this cause\nit's the simplest one and the name row\n\nhere actually goes really well with\nhow Flexbox works and how Flexbox names\n\nthings because Flexbox behavior acts\nas it's a row and that row gets,\n\nso a row would be going all the way\nacross and then that row can get broken up\n\ninto individual columns\nthat are inside of that.\n\nSo it's exactly what we want to be doing\nand the funding with Flexbox is it's\n\nreally easy to do this [inaudible].\nIf you were watching this awhile,\n\na few years ago,\n\nyou might be thinking or\nyou may be learning about\nfloats right now and just be\n\nreally happy that you're not.\n\nSo I'm going to come here in my CSS file\nwith the container class and I'm going\n\nto come right underneath it and do row.\n\nAnd all I'm going to do for now\nis a display of flex on there.\n\nAnd just like that, we have some columns.\nSo let's go look at my HTML again.\n\nSo we have my container class here and\nall that's doing is holding it in the\n\ncenter. I'm reusing the\nsame container I use there.\n\nSo that means it's setting\na max width on that.\n\nIt means it's going to be responsive,\n\nit's going to shrink and it's\ngoing to grow, right? Uh,\n\nwe know that our content won't\ntouch the sides, which is fantastic.\n\nThe display flex on here,\n\ndisplay flex pretty much says this\nitem or this div is becoming a row.\n\nthe default of this is a flex\ndirection of RO right there.\n\nSo that's the default.\n\nSo it's calling this a row and that\nmeans all of the children are becoming,\n\nall of the direct children of this row\nare becoming columns and it's forcing\n\nthem all go next to each other.\n\nNow there's actually a lot of things\nthat are happening here that aren't super\n\nobvious. So the first thing I'm\ngoing to let you know is that a row,\n\nsomething like this, uh,\nwhen we do a display, oops,\n\nwhen we do a display of flex,\nthis is getting called, um,\n\nso display\n\n[inaudible] is going to make that item\ninto something we call a flex container.\n\nSo the flex container is going to have\na flex direction of row by default.\n\nSo here I can rate the default equals\nrow and we can't change that behavior.\n\nSo just for fun, if I change that to\ncolumn, which is the only other one,\n\nthat means if the container is a\ncolumn, the children will become rows,\n\nwhich means the go all the way across.\n\nThat looks a lot like what things you\nsaw like so for now we're not going to do\n\nthat. We're going to leave it like this.\n\nIf wondering why you might want to make\nthe flex direction a column that can be\n\nuseful for a number of reasons. Uh,\n\none of them is that you\nwant to keep the defaults,\n\nbut you want to take advantage of some\nof the options that flex offers. Uh,\n\nit could be for responsive design.\n\nThere are a few different reasons\nyou might want to, but for now,\n\nlet's not stress too much on that.\n\nSo I've created my three items\ncoming across like that. Now,\n\nthe columns themselves. Dot. Call. Uh,\n\nfor now we're just going\nto put in that these,\n\nbecause they're the children of my row.\n\nThese are now [inaudible] items.\n\nWe have a flex containers, the parent\nand the flex items or the child.\n\nIt's always good to know the\nright naming of these things,\n\nbut these are the flex items.\n\nNow you might notice that these were in\na dev writing. If we come and look here,\n\nthese were all dibs and dibs by default\nhave a width of 100% but notice how\n\nthey're not actually taking up 100%\nobviously anymore cause they've gotten\n\nsqueezed in next to each other.\n\nNow one thing that's really important\nto know about flex items is that they\n\nactually are trying to shrink down to\nthe smallest possible size they can be.\n\nSo you might, you know,\n\nthese are actually dibs and\na div by default has a width\nof 100% these no longer\n\nwant to be 100% and just to show you what\nwe're going to do or what I'm going to\n\ndo is I'm going to give each\none of them a background.\n\nWe'll give them all the same background\nteller. We'll say background is, uh,\n\nwe'll do lime green, let me,\n\nit really stands out and we'll\ngive them a margin of 10 pixels.\n\nJust we have a gap when we can see\nthem separated a little bit like that.\n\nAnd what I'm going to do is let's go into\nthis first one here and let's take off\n\nthe paragraph and notice how it's shrunk\ndown to the smallest possible size that\n\nit could.\n\nFlex items by default want to be\nas small as they possibly can be.\n\nIf I take off the age two here\nand there's no content in there,\n\nit actually disappears and that was a\nwidth of zero because there's no content\n\nin there. This is really, really\ninteresting and a little bit strange.\n\nLet's turn those back on.\n\nAnd one thing that's important is because\nthese paragraphs are longer than the\n\ntotal line they want, these paragraphs\nare trying to sit at 100% width.\n\nIf I only had one of these,\nlet's turn those off. You know,\n\nsee that this line of text is going\nlonger than the longer than the available\n\nspace. So it's wrapping around.\n\nSo that's why this isn't\nshrinking down to the word cheap.\n\nIt's not trying to go to the smallest\namount of space available. It's this,\n\nthis paragraph here is actually pushing\nit and forcing [inaudible] these dibs to\n\nbe a little bit bigger.\n\nSo what's happening now is it's actually\ntrying to squeeze them all in so it's\n\nthis one's trying to be 100% this one's\nturned to be 100% this one's trying to\n\nbe 100% because they are\nchildren of this row.\n\nThey all have to fit in one row together.\n\nIf I came and I actually took more of\nthese columns and we create more of them,\n\nlet's just make a whole bunch and see\nhow it's actually causing side scrolling.\n\nIt's breaking outside.\n\nIt's overflowing out the side because\nit's trying to fit them all within one\n\nsingle row and it's\ndoing everything it can.\n\nIt's even shrinking needs to be smaller\nthan they can be cause there's just run\n\nout of room. As long as\nyou have room for stuff,\n\nyou're not going to run\ninto any issues like that.\n\nEverything will just sort\nof balance itself out, uh,\n\nwhich is kind of convenient.\n\nAnd if ever you're running\ninto an issue where you want,\n\nyou say one of these actually does have\nshorter content and you want to make\n\nsure that they're all the same size,\n\nwhat you can do is you could give them\na width of 100% so because they're all\n\ntrying to be 100%,\n\nthey're going to even out and\nevenly distribute within that space.\n\nThis 100% has now become [inaudible] the\nideal size that it wants to be because\n\nflex is going to force\nthem into that sizing. Uh,\n\nthe other thing we can do is actually we\ncould take these and make them all 10%\n\nand that's the ideal size.\n\nThey're actually going to sit at 10%\nif the ideal size is smaller than the\n\navailable space, there's\nno problem. Flex can do it.\n\nBut if the amount of space that they\nhave is, you know, if there were,\n\nwe're at 300% here, it\ncan't fit inside that space,\n\nit's going to evenly distribute it as\nmuch as possible unless it really can't\n\nfit. And that's when you get\nthese overflowing issues.\n\nNow I went over a whole\nbunch of stuff here.\n\nIf flex is not something you're\nused to, you might be going, Kevin,\n\nwhat just happened?\n\nSo the main thing to remember at this\nstage is when you have multiple dibs that\n\nare all within a parent, by default,\n\nwe'll have something where they just\nall stack one on top of each other.\n\nAs soon as we do a display flex, they're\ngoing to want to go next to each other.\n\nInstead you're going to\nwant to become columns.\n\nThe flex items by default will want\nto become columns inside of their flex\n\ncontainer. This is always\nthe direct children,\n\nso it won't affect any of the\ngrandchildren or any, you know,\n\nif it's nested inside of a column,\nit doesn't get affected at all.\n\nSo that is important to remember as well.\n\nNow by default you also get this one\nissue where there will all be stuck\n\ntogether and you obviously want\nto create some space there.\n\nWe're going to get into that in future\nvideos though I don't want to overwhelm\n\ntoo much.\n\nThe main thing I wanted to look at in\nthis video is what happens when you\n\ncreate, when you do a display flex,\n\nso the columns are going to try and shrink\ndown to their minimum possible size.\n\nThat's really, really\nimportant. So sometimes so you,\n\nif you set it with of 100%\nand there's multiple ones,\n\nthey're going to squeeze into that\nspace and all being equal size.\n\nSo that is also really important to know.\n\nThose are pretty much the main\ntakeaways from this video.\n\nSo if you're comfortable with that,\n\nand really at the end of the day it's\nalways nice to really understand it.\n\nBut when you're first\ngetting started with that,\n\nall you have to remember is take\na parent, make it display flex,\n\nand automatically\n\nthose are going to adjust to\nthe available screen size.\n\nSo if that's bigger, it's\nfine and if it gets smaller,\n\nthey're going to shrink\nand shrink and shrink.\n\nAnd obviously right now our layout at\nsmall sizes is not working really well,\n\nbut we're getting a responsive\nwebsite. There are issues with it.\n\nWe're going to get there.\nWe're going to solve these.\n\nWe've created this nicely out here that\nadjust your screen size more or less.\n\nWe have an issue with it, but it\nstill does. We have this area,\n\nnow that we've created some columns in,\n\nwe're going to look at how we can create\nsome spacing on those columns and then\n\nI'm going to have a bit\nof a challenge for you.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/260392-day-8-flexbox-basics/750221-an-introduction-to-flexbox?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_721">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/3vow9u8tgo","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT5M8S","name":"02-02-adding-space_1.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/07d0a2f8d57aa0e41e84bf4e76025997b1c7f510.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/a2174e67807de9d9e41df6109eef5f4ea182c31d.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/3vow9u8tgo","uploadDate":"2020-04-19","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"We're going to look at two different ways.\n\nYou can actually create\nspacing between columns.\n\nThe first one is one that\nyou can't actually use yet,\n\nbut I'm super excited about. I just\nwant to let you know that it exists.\n\nSo if you're watching this in the future,\n\nmaybe you can actually use it\nor if you're just, you know,\n\nhopefully I can put it in\nyour mind a little bit.\n\nSo you remember about it once it becomes\na feature that we can actually use.\n\nSo what it is is a property called gap.\n\nSo if I come into my row and I just rate\ngap and I'm going to make it really big\n\nso we can see at work a\nhundred pixels and hit save,\n\nwe get a gap of a hundred\npixels in between each one\nand it doesn't mess at all\n\nwith our layout. It doesn't cause any\nissues, it doesn't break anything.\n\nIt just creates a space of a hundred\npixels between each one of the flex items.\n\nAnd it does not affect\nto be outside spacing.\n\nIf you're familiar at all with\nCSS grid, you'll recognize this.\n\nNow you may go with the Kevin. That's\nfantastic. Why can we not use it?\n\nIt's only supported in Firefox right now.\n\nAnd if you want to know in the\nfuture if you're can use it,\n\nwhat I would suggest is going to,\n\ncan I use and writing in gap and it\nactually is the first one here at the top.\n\nBelow is the one for CSS grid.\n\nBut right here we have the one for gap\nand certainly as you can see it's only\n\nFirefox that is currently\nsupporting it. Mmm.\n\nIt's not even on the horizon\nhere for Chrome or Safari. So.\n\nSo hopefully it makes it in there sooner\nrather than later cause this is going\n\nto make all our lives easier.\n\nBut this would be the site that I would\nsuggest checking out if you want to see\n\nwhere support is, uh, with the gap\nfeature. But because we can't use gaps,\n\nso I'll leave this in here, can't use yet.\n\nWhat we can use is a\nnice little uh, trick,\n\nI guess. It's an interesting selector.\n\nSo it's called plus call.\n\nAnd I'm going to just do now for the\nmoment just to illustrate what this\n\nselector is actually doing. I'm\njust gonna use a background color,\n\nthe background color. We'll\ngo with our lime green again\n\nand you can see that the second and\nthe third one have become lime green,\n\nbut not the first one. So this\nis actually called a Combinator.\n\nThere's a whole list of\ndifferent Combinator if you\nwant some of the other ones\n\nthat you can use. I do have a\nYouTube video that covers them,\n\nso I'll put a link to that\nin or just below this video.\n\nWith this Combinator here\nis doing is [inaudible].\n\nIt's selecting the adjacent sibling.\n\nSo if a column has an\nadjacent sibling of column,\n\nit's going to select it.\nSo this one doesn't have an\nadjacent sibling before it.\n\nIt's only looking if something\ncomes before it. Oh, even it's in,\n\nit doesn't even matter visually what it\nlooks like. It's really looking here.\n\nIs this have a column before\nit? Nope, it doesn't. Okay.\n\nThis one's not being selected. Is\nthis one have a column before it? Yes,\n\nit does. Okay. So that means\nwe can select this one.\n\nDoes this one have a column\nbefore it? It does. Great.\n\nWe can select that one here.\n\nSo can you think of how instead of\nputting a background color on here,\n\nwe could actually simulate that exact\nsame thing the gap did by using this\n\nselect here. Uh, so think about it. Try\nit out. If you want in your own code.\n\nI'm not going to make a new\nvideo or make this a challenge,\n\nbut just take a few\nseconds to think about it.\n\nSee if you can come up with an answer\nand I'll give you a few seconds to think\n\nMaybe pause the video if you're not\ntoo sure and then I'll show you the\n\nsolution. All right? So,\nuh, if you didn't get it,\n\nthat's all good. If you\ndid, congratulations.\n\nAnd all we want is a margin left and then\nlet's do a hundred pixels just so it's\n\nthe same as the gap that we\nhad. And so it's a margin left.\n\nNow why am I doing a margin left?\nWell, I want a margin left on this one.\n\nAnd on this one.\n\nThat's creating a space on the left of\nthis one here and it's creating a space\n\non the left of this one right\nhere, so it's exactly what we had.\n\nNow a hundred pixels is really big.\nMaybe we'd go with, I don't know,\n\n30 16 it depends on the grid\nsystem that you are using,\n\nbut something like that for\nme looks okay right now,\n\nso that's one easy way that you can\ncreate gaps between it without anything\n\nthat's overly complicated\nor too, you know,\n\nwithout anything that's overly\ncomplicated and I think it works really,\n\nreally well. Now there's other\nsolutions too that will work.\n\nIt depends on the layout\nthat you're creating,\n\nbut in these ones where you have\nthree equal columns that by default,\n\nbecause if, because we\nhave so much text in there,\n\nby default they're going to be 100% with\nanyway because of all of this text like\n\nwe saw.\n\nIt's a nice way to be able to create the\ngap without having to come and fiddle\n\naround with widths. I find\nthis the simplest one to do.\n\nNow we're going to see other situations\nwhere we're going to get into a big two\n\ncolumn layout where things are a little\nbit different, but we're not there yet.\n\nSo in the next video,\n\nI'm going to give you a little\nchallenge on something to work on.\n\nWe're going to fix this up, make\nit look a little bit prettier,\n\nadding a few more columns in another row.\n\nThat's what your challenge is going to be.\n\nAnd then tomorrow we're actually\ngoing to jump back into it. Uh,\n\nso not a long break, like last week, cause\nwe do have a lot of content to cover.\n\nIn the next video, we'll\nsee what your challenges.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/260392-day-8-flexbox-basics/750206-adding-space-in-between-columns?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_774">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/fnkmjddfjc","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT1M41S","name":"02-03-challenge_1.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/c25b38973f0537f8386a34937d3e5ef0911889b1.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/890da4b060b8d7491eeb29774b26a451990c5ab8.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/fnkmjddfjc","uploadDate":"2020-04-19","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"it's your challenge for this week is\nto recreate the layout I have here.\n\nSo I'm actually leaving\nyou with what we just had,\n\nwhich is something that\nlooks just like this.\n\nSo these are the files that you can start\nwith. If you want a bigger challenge,\n\nyou could just Recode.

Coach Uploads video","transcript":"Okay.\n\nSo this is where we left off and let's\njust jump over to my CSS file here.\n\nUm,\n\nso in this challenge I said you will\nhave to modify the HTML because well we\n\nneed to fix what's happening there.\n\nif you need to,\n\nwe can add new classes,\n\nwhich I'm going to be doing\nto change some colors around.\n\nIf you did that just with some,\n\ndescendants selectors and stuff,\n\nthat would be completely fine.\n\nAnd the requirements,\n\nthe headings here must\nbe a different color.\n\nThe columns at the bottom\nmust go next to one another,\n\nuh,\n\nnext to each other,\n\njust like we saw,\n\num,\n\nin the design specs,\n\nthe section at the bottom should have a\ndifferent color and I removed the gaps.\n\nWe have to put that back in.\n\nSo I'm going to start over in my HTML\nfile to be doing this because this is a\n\nbit of a problem.\n\nI'm going to use the exact\nsame pattern I used here.\n\nSo we'll go right here and\nI'm going to start with it.\n\nCan [inaudible] and I'll just cut\nthat and move it all the way down\n\nto the bottom.\n\nAnd if I hit saved there,\n\nwe should see it at least move in.\n\nSo it's lining up with everything else.\n\nSo that's why my container here,\n\nI'm sticking with that.\n\nAnd if someone in the discord didn't ask,\n\nif I'm using sort of the,\n\nthe hero text style.\n\nSo my hero then hero text,\n\nif I would have a hero container,\n\nbecause container is something that\nI'm reusing over and over again.\n\nI'm not calling it hero container because\nthen I'd have to have a hero container\n\nand like a main container and a\nsecondary container and things like that.\n\nSo,\n\num,\n\nat the time when we just\ncreated this top part,\n\nif you called it something else,\n\nthat's completely fine cause we were\nout of context with everything else.\n\nBut in a case like this because,\n\nand I sort of knew we\nwere where we were going,\n\nso I had an unfair advantage.\n\nbut now we can go through and\nsee that we're reusing them.\n\nSame with here,\n\nI'm not going to do like a container row\nand a container column just gets long\n\nfor nothing.\n\nSo we did that.\n\nAnd then I want to come in\nhere and do a div class of row\n\nand I'll take back closing NIV and\ndrop it right there and just hit\n\ntab to IX.\n\nThat and now at least we have\nour two columns like that.\n\nSo it's a pretty good start.\n\nLet's come back over to here\nand we'll set a few things up.\n\nSo one of them is I had removed the gaps,\n\nwe'll start with the gap cause that\none we looked at together already.\n\nSo that was just my call plus.\n\nDot co and I want to set a margin on that.\n\nSo in this case,\n\nwhatever you put,\n\nI gave no specifications on it.\n\nUp until now I haven't given any\nreal specifications on anything.\n\nUm,\n\nso you know,\n\nit's just eyeballing it later on we are\ngoing to get into some more specific use\n\ncases and trying to match\nmy briefs in a lot more.\n\nThey're going to be a lot more detailed.\n\nthe design briefs I will be giving you,\n\nand we don't want to marginalize\ncause you can see it's,\n\nit's opposite there.\n\nThere should have been a margin left.\n\nAnd so it's only adding the\nmargin to the left side.\n\nThat looks a little bit better.\n\nOkay,\n\nnow is the next part.\n\nAnd let's go back and look the next thing.\n\nSo we want the titles here\nto be a different color.\n\nSo there's a few different\nways that we could do that.\n\nUm,\n\nI'm going to come over here and\nadd a couple of classes now.\n\nUh,\n\nso here I'm going to give this a,\n\nand if you added a class like\nthat to here on this container,\n\nit'd be perfectly fine.\n\nBut,\n\num,\n\nI'm going to give this one a section.\n\nI don't have a whoops,\n\nI don't want it like that.\n\nI want it a section like this,\n\nI'm going to call it three call because\nwe don't have real content here.\n\nSo my naming convention through\nthis part might not be the best.\n\nUm,\n\nso this section has three columns in\nit and I am going to close that section\n\ndown here at the bottom.\n\nso that will be this area with\nthese three columns in it.\n\nSo my three call and then\ndown here I have my two call.\n\nSo we're just going to\ncall it that two columns.\n\nSo section.to call.\n\nWhy am I using a section instead of a div?\n\njust cause I see it as a section of\ncontent now it's not perfect or we do\n\nhave headings in here.\n\ngenerally there,\n\nthere should be a single heading for\na section and then these would be like\n\nsubheadings or subsections of that.\n\nso we're not perfectly semantic right now,\n\nbut because there's sections of content,\n\nI'm going to stick with it just like that.\n\nso nothing changes.\n\nBut the reason that I'm wrapping all\nof this and our markup is getting a lot\n\nbusier.\n\nBut the reason I'm wrapping all of\nthat here inside my section is so I\n\ncan do different things\nwith those sections.\n\nSo let's just come here after\nmy hero and here I can have my\n\nthree call,\n\nso I don't need to in this case,\n\nbut if I wanted to give it a background,\n\nI could give it a background and\nwe can change the color there.\n\nNow in this case,\n\nI don't want to do that.\n\nthe only thing I really need to do\nactually is to change the color of these\n\ntitles.\n\nUm,\n\ndepending on how you like to work,\n\nyou could give each one\nof these titles a class.\n\nSo I could come over to here\nand I could add a class is equal\n\nto,\n\nand there's different\napproaches you could take here.\n\nI could do three call title,\n\nso it's a title living inside of three\ncall and then I could come over here.\n\nSo we could do double underscore\ntitle and color is purple\n\n[inaudible] and,\n\nbut we got to save both files.\n\nIf you're doing that,\n\nyou can see that one has changed and then\nI could go ahead and place that class\n\nname over here and place\nthat class name over here.\n\nDoing that is perfectly valid.\n\nAnother way you could do something is\nsomething like this where you call it a\n\naccent text,\n\nlet's say.\n\nAnd then I could come here and instead\nof this one we could say accent\n\ntext [inaudible].\n\nThe advantage with a class like that\nis let's say for fun on my hero.\n\nUm,\n\nI put a span here,\n\nclass equals accent text.\n\nI'm just going to turn\nword wrap off for a second.\n\nSo have my accent,\n\ntext responsive layouts and\nthen I could close my spam.\n\nSo it's going to make that it looks\nreally ugly and we can't read it.\n\nSo we'll take that off in a second.\n\nbut if we,\n\nthe accent texts becomes\na more reusable style.\n\nSo if you wanted to do that approach,\n\nby all means you can do that approach.\n\nI'm just going to remove\nthis from here so it's not,\n\nwe don't need it in there anymore.\n\nUm,\n\nso that would work.\n\nWe could do accent text here and accent\ntexts there or what I'm assuming a lot\n\nof people did was similar\nto what I did here,\n\nwhich would be something like,\n\num,\n\nsection three,\n\nthree calls.\n\nUm,\n\nand then we could just do my [inaudible].\n\nSo it's selecting all the age two is\ninside of there and we can change their\n\ncolor.\n\nSo we might as well go with the right\ncolor this time since I'll leave it this\n\nway.\n\nUh,\n\na seven,\n\nsix,\n\nnine,\n\neight.\n\nThere we go.\n\nAnd they all switch over.\n\nSo,\n\num,\n\nwhich one is the best one to do?\n\nHmm.\n\nI personally,\n\nif you watch me on YouTube,\n\nyou'll know that I generally don't do it\nwith the descendant selector like this.\n\nUm,\n\nI just wanted to show you some\ndifferent options that you could use.\n\nI'm a big fan of everything.\n\nHaving a class name and however that\nworks is however you decide to do it.\n\nWhether it's something like the accent\ntext or something like the three calls,\n\ntitle,\n\nI tend to do the three calls\ntitle because I'm doing the BEM.\n\nbut having a reusable class\nname can also be really handy.\n\nSo whichever one you did\nchoose out of the three,\n\nyou're in the right direction,\n\nit doesn't really matter.\n\nthe one thing I am going to do on three\ncall here is give this a padding of top\n\nand bottom.\n\nSo we'll say a padding top of 3m and\nleft and right of zero and that would\n\nbe top and bottom are both three.\n\nSo it's creating some empty space on\nthe top and empty space on the bottom.\n\nI am using M instead of [inaudible],\n\npixels just because I'm so used to\nusing [inaudible] for all my units now.\n\nAnd so I'm going to stick with that.\n\nAnd remember 3:00 AM would just be\ntaking the font size that I have here and\n\nthen multiplying that by three.\n\nAnd that gives you your approximate space.\n\nif you use REM or if you use pixels here,\n\nhonestly,\n\nat the end of the day it\nwouldn't make a huge difference.\n\nUm,\n\nso the next thing I can do is come\ndown to my two calls and that one had a\n\nbackground color on it,\n\nwhich will set the real one that we used,\n\nwhich I think was two,\n\nfour,\n\nfour a [inaudible].\n\nAnd let's go take a look.\n\nNo,\n\nwhich was one,\n\nthree,\n\nsix C 72.\n\nIf you didn't reuse the real colors again,\n\nit really isn't a big deal,\n\nat all.\n\nAnd this one's a little bit easier for\nthe text color cause we could just say\n\nhere at color is white or\nFFF and it works because\n\nit's inheriting all of our text\nby default except for links.\n\nand a couple of other\nthings along the way.\n\nThey always inherit the\ncolor of the parent.\n\nso here these are inheriting it so\nI don't even have to select them.\n\nAnd we can also come on here and add the\nsame padding tiding of three M zero or\n\nconsistency.\n\nAnd they get my space on the\ntop and the bottom right there.\n\nSo\n\nI didn't put it in the\nrequirements at the top,\n\nbut I think what I also wanted to\ndo with central line everything.\n\nSo I'm just going to come on\nhere and do a text align center\n\nand then also on my other one,\n\na text Alliance center like\nthat and everything gets\n\ncentered.\n\nUh,\n\none of the important that or one other\napproach you could do is just like I\n\nshowed you with the color of the text,\n\nI could make a class that just centers\nthe text and then apply that in both\n\nplaces.\n\nThat would work perfectly fine as well.\n\nOr if you said like sections are all\ngoing to be center aligned or if you found\n\nanother approach for it,\n\nas long as we get there to here in the\nend it should be good and because we're\n\nusing Flexbox to a certain extent,\n\nthis will be flexible.\n\nNow it's not going to be\nperfectly flexible so oops,\n\nthat's a little too big right now.\n\nSo let's shrink that down.\n\nNow you can see it is adapting to our\nscreen sizes and because our container\n\ndoes have the max width on it,\n\nlet's just make that a bit bigger.\n\nwe do lock in at a maximum screen size,\n\nso for medium screen sizes\nand big screen sizes,\n\nwe're good and everything will\nsquish down for small screen sizes.\n\nWe are going to run into some issues here,\n\nbut right now with what\nwe've learned so far,\n\nthis is just perfect.\n\nWe're definitely on the right track.\n\nWe're definitely going\nin the right direction.\n\nAnd the reason,\n\njust to jump back to here,\n\nthe reason I went so heavy on my classes,\n\nso I have my section where I can\nset padding and background colors.\n\nI have my container,\n\nwhich is just holding my content in the\ncenter of the page and remember that\n\nonly has a width of percentage\non it plus a max width on it,\n\nso that way I know it will\nshrink if it needs to,\n\nbut it will never get too\nbig at large screen sizes.\n\nMy row is just creating a display\nflex and not doing anything else.\n\nAnd then my columns are just\nacting to hold the content.\n\nThey're not really doing\na whole lot else and yeah,\n\nthat's about it.\n\nAs far as layout comes in,\n\nthis project.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/261733-day-9-a-deeper-dive-into-flexbox/755508-my-solution-to-flexbox-challenge-1?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required

Coach Uploads video","transcript":"All right.\n\nSo one of the things I told you that I\nwas going to look at was how we could\n\nactually remove some of this extra stuff,\n\num,\n\nor have less dibs coming into our markup.\n\nSo this is where,\n\nthe container row column\nI did take from bootstrap,\n\nI think it's a very clear and\nobvious naming convention.\n\nSo that's one of the reasons I do like it,\n\nespecially when using\nFlexbox for my layouts.\n\nIf ever you decide or you think\nit's a little bit too much going on,\n\nwhat you could do is I can actually move\nRO over to be with my container here\n\nand then take this div away.\n\nSo what this is doing is this one,\n\nmy container is now setting a maximum\nwidth and the width and the maximum width.\n\nAnd then the row here is doing something\nreally interesting where this is just\n\ndoing a display flex,\n\nright?\n\nSo this is making this div have a width,\n\na max width,\n\nand now have the display flex on it.\n\nSo if I save that,\n\nit's going to react and\nbehave exactly the same way.\n\nEverything both areas are working.\n\nThere's no issue.\n\nSo if I come back up to here,\n\nI can do the same thing and put it right\nthere and we can get rid of that one\n\nand get rid of its\nclosing div right there.\n\nIt save and literally nothing will change.\n\nEverything is behaving\nin the exact same way.\n\nSo that is one way you could do it.\n\none thing you could do is you could change\nthe name of a row now into something\n\nelse cause it's a\ncontainer and it's a row.\n\nIf you don't like that,\n\nyou might have like a D flex is\nactually one of the naming conventions.\n\nBootstrap uses.\n\nSo display flex,\n\nthat's all this class is going to do.\n\nYou could just call it even flex if\nyou wanted it to and do it that way.\n\nSo it's a container that's\nalso a flex container.\n\nso it is an option.\n\nI'm going to leave it as a row for now\nbecause for me in the way I see my name,\n\nuh,\n\nthe way I see my naming,\n\nthat does make sense to me.\n\nSo I'm going to leave it just like this.\n\nBut if ever you feel that you want to\npush that a little bit more or play with\n\nthe naming conventions,\n\nby all means go for it.\n\nIt takes a while to get used to coming\nup with naming conventions that you like,\n\nbut the more consistent you are with them,\n\nyou'll definitely run into some ways\nof working that you like to work.\n\nSo whether you like having this as a\ncontainer with a row and then a column,\n\nor you like this idea of\nsimplifying a little bit,\n\nboth of them are completely valid.\n\nThe one thing I wouldn't do is have my\ncontainer also be a display flex because\n\nyou may have times when you\nneed a container that you\ndon't want to be display\n\nflex.\n\nDo you want that container to be the\nfull width and not break its content?\n\nYou don't want its content\nto turn into columns.\n\nSo I really like separating\nthe responsibility across\ntwo classes for something\n\nlike this.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/261733-day-9-a-deeper-dive-into-flexbox/755462-reducing-the-amount-of-html-needed?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required

Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So this is the layout and this\nis the layout we're going to be\n\nworking towards.\n\nNow.\n\nwhat I'm going to do is\nwork on this top section,\n\nexplain a few things to you and then\nyour challenge is going to be to also do\n\nthat but also include this bottom part\nhere and once we've figured out how to do\n\nwe're going to move into,\n\nokay.\n\nAnd then in a couple of days we'll be\nback to add a navigation to the site cause\n\nthat's another fun exploration\nof Flexbox as well.\n\nWe're going to look at a few new\nthings there that we haven't seen yet.\n\nThis one is mostly using things\nthat we've already taken a look at.\n\nso I'm actually going to minimize\nthis and keep it off screen for now.\n\nI'm going to minimize this and\nkeep it off screen for now.\n\nAnd as you can see,\n\nI've deleted a lot of\nthe work that we've done,\n\nbut I want to bring my image over to here.\n\nDo you remember when?\n\nSo you may remember when\nI created this area,\n\nI've wrapped all of this\nin a div and I said,\n\nthis is really important.\n\nUm,\n\nif you didn't do it at the time,\n\nand I had a few people asking me,\n\ncould I have put a width\non this and on this?\n\nAnd definitely at the\ntime it would have worked.\n\nAnd if you did it that way,\n\nthere's no problem.\n\nBut now I want to start\nusing display flex.\n\nSo it's really important we don't do that.\n\nAnd just to show you why it's really\nimportant is let's say I didn't have this\n\ndip here and we'll get rid of that\nand everything's working really well.\n\nwe've lost our width,\n\nbut that's fine.\n\nBut one thing is if you\nwould go and look at my CSS,\n\nI've kept,\n\nmy whoops were literate,\n\nis my row class here.\n\nSo if I were to come and throw\nthat row onto here to give this a\n\ndisplay,\n\na flex,\n\nbefore I even do it,\n\nI want you to think what\nmight happen when I do that.\n\nSo,\n\nuh,\n\nI don't know what you thought.\n\nAnd I wonder is it this?\n\nthat's weird.\n\nAnd that's awkward and that's annoying.\n\nso basically though,\n\nif we think of a,\n\nwhat Flexbox does when we use display\nflex is it's turning each one of these,\n\nit's creating it's row.\n\nSo the parent is becoming the row and\neach one of these is now becoming a\n\ncolumn.\n\nAnd so because of that one,\n\ntwo,\n\nthree columns,\n\nwhich we don't want.\n\nSo let's bring back my div class\nequals hero text once again.\n\nAnd then over here I can\nclose that div and hit save.\n\nAnd now we don't run into that issue.\n\nokay.\n\nI need to remove closing day.\n\nThat got created up here.\n\nThere we go.\n\nNow we're back to normal and everything\nis exactly how it was before.\n\nUm,\n\nvery quickly I am going to come to my\nhero div that I created and I'm going to\n\ntake this with off for the moment.\n\nWe're going to come back and\nexplore how width is going to work,\n\nuh,\n\nfor that,\n\num,\n\nas we move forward.\n\nBut I'm going to leave it\noff there for the time being.\n\nAnd let's come in and now\nwe want to add the image.\n\nNow there's two choices\nfor adding the image.\n\nYou could just do the image here.\n\nUm,\n\nI am gonna use Emmett,\n\nso it's IMG at tab.\n\nMy source is going to be my\nimage folder and hero image dot\n\nJPEG.\n\nAnd there's an issue that happens here\nand that's the image is actually being\n\nstretched out.\n\nNow you don't know this image,\n\nyou might not recognize that\nit's being stretched out.\n\nbut it is,\n\nbefore we worry about that,\n\nwe'll do um,\n\ncolor UX design,\n\nwebsite sketches.\n\nWe'll just call it that a\nlittle bit more than that.\n\nBut it's always good to include an\nalt to describe what your image is.\n\nJust,\n\nit's always a good idea to include an\nAlta to describe what your images and\n\nwhatever you do on these don't\nput a picture of or an image of\n\nor whatever it is.\n\nYou don't need that.\n\nYou just say what is in your image.\n\nUm,\n\nnow what's happening here is,\n\nand you might've noticed before when\nour text all became three columns,\n\nis this guy here.\n\nThe button had actually got really tall\nand it was like this big weird shaped\n\nbutton.\n\nWhat happens when we use display flex is\nit actually stretches all the elements\n\nto be equal in height.\n\nSo here this hero text,\n\nlet's put a background on that.\n\nA hero text background will be yellow\n\njust so it really stands out.\n\nAnd I have it on here.\n\n[inaudible] no.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's what we'll do here is I'll\ncome to here and I'll just give this a\n\nbackground of yellow\n\nand we can see that the here is\nexactly the same as the height here.\n\nIf I were to remove\nthis paragraph of text,\n\nit will shrink the height of this down.\n\nSo the height of this is\nactually shrinking down.\n\nAnd so,\n\nuh,\n\none,\n\nthere's a few different ways\nthat we can get around this.\n\nOne of them is to wherever\nwe're declaring our,\n\nactually I'll leave that\nthere for the moment.\n\nThat's just choose a,\n\nI'll put Brown so it's\nnot so rough on the eyes.\n\nAnd where I declared my display flex,\n\nI could do a F,\n\num,\n\nalign items,\n\nuh,\n\nflex start and that means\nthey're aligning to the top them\n\nalign items or relative to\nthe up and down for now.\n\nWe're going to explore that\nin a bit more detail later on,\n\nbut it's relative to the up and\ndown for the moment or the vertical.\n\nIt's relative to the\nvertical axis for now.\n\nWe're going to get into more\ndetail of that a little bit later,\n\nbut we're saying align vertically\nand we want to align to the top.\n\nSo that's my flex start.\n\nNow in general,\n\nI like keeping my road doing the\nleast amount of stuff possible.\n\nSo instead of doing that,\n\nthe other option that we could do is I\ncan come over here and I could wrap this\n\nso I could do div a hero image.\n\nThere's actually two\ndifferent things I could do.\n\nOne of them would be to come to here\nand actually wrap this in a div.\n\nI'm not even going to\ngive it a class for now,\n\nso I could do a diff like that and close.\n\nAnd as long as it's in a div,\n\nit's not going to stretch anymore.\n\nIt's the diff,\n\nthat stretching.\n\nSo this div here,\n\nthis is give it a style\nequals order two pixels\n\nsolid.\n\nThink\n\nwe can see that div is\nstretching the full height,\n\nbut the image isn't stretching to fit in,\n\nfit inside of there.\n\nIt's just being what it wants to be.\n\nSo that is one option.\n\nIf you want to do that where\nthis is like your image,\n\na hero image,\n\ndiv or something like that,\n\nwe could do it that way.\n\nI do like trying to keep my\nmarkup as simple as possible.\n\nSo here where I have my image,\n\nI'm going to add a class on here.\n\nWe'll turn off a word wrap so we\ncan actually see the whole thing.\n\nso here on the image I would give\nthis a class of hero IMG or hero\n\nimage like that.\n\nNow if I do that,\n\nit's stretching once again.\n\nBut here where I have my hero hero text,\n\nuh,\n\nI'll do it right here.\n\nMy hero,\n\nI M G on this one I could say\ninstead of aligning all my items,\n\nI can actually choose an\nindividual item and do a flex,\n\nwhoops,\n\nflex,\n\nstart on that.\n\nSo I'm telling this item that I by\nitself to align to the start instead of\n\ntelling all of the items that they\nshould be aligning to the start on the\n\nparent.\n\nSo you can do it either for individual\nitems or for individual things along way.\n\nThis might seem a little bit strange.\n\nUm,\n\nif you prefer the div approach for now,\n\nby all means use that.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\nIt works.\n\nIt's going to get the job done.\n\nIt's not going to cause\nany issues with layouts.\n\nSo by all means,\n\nchoose the one that you want to\nchoose for the rest of this challenge.\n\nso for now I'm just going to turn off\nthis background here and just like that we\n\nhave things starting to\ncome together a little bit.\n\nIf you're annoyed by the spacing here,\n\nthat is the margin top on this text\nthat you could remove to fix that up a\n\nlittle bit.\n\nThere is one last issue though before\nwe move on and that's what the size of\n\nthis image right now on the,\n\nwith the,\n\nthere is a one issue\nwith the image though.\n\nSo in the next video we're\ngoing to explore just\nsomething that you may run into\n\nat one point and a really easy way to\nfix it because images by default art\n\nreflects it,\n\naren't responsive.\n\nNow this one is because it's a flex item,\n\nso we'll adjust a,\n\nbut I want to look at an issue with images\nthat can come up just in case you do\n\nrun into them in the future.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/261733-day-9-a-deeper-dive-into-flexbox/755501-adding-a-hero-image?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required

Coach Uploads video","transcript":"I like my border on here because I want\nto highlight exactly what's happening.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nUm,\n\nso,\n\nand this is going to be a\nlittle weird at one point.\n\nfor sure.\n\nSo I'm going to come here,\n\nI have my hero text and\nI have my hero image.\n\nI'm going to move the hero P underneath\ncause these are for the moment are the\n\ntwo that I'm most worried about.\n\nSo the first thing I'm going to do is\ntake the whip off of here and hit save and\n\nyou can see that,\n\nwell this is a lot smaller\nthan this one all of a sudden.\n\nAnd the bigger I make it,\n\nit's still,\n\nthis is stretching a\nlot more than my image.\n\nAnd that's kind of weird,\n\nWhen we had those three things down here,\n\nthey were all equal sizes.\n\nbecause my texture is really long and\nit's trying to push that bigger and bigger\n\nand bigger and bigger,\n\nwhereas my image has the room to shrink.\n\nSo it's just tricking down to fit\nbecause it's one item by itself.\n\nIf you remember,\n\nif there's no content,\n\nflex items actually want to shrink\ndown to the smallest possible size.\n\nSo basically that's sort of what's\nhappening with my image here.\n\nMore or less,\n\nif I were to give this it with\nthem 100% and my hero image,\n\nremember that's the red box right there.\n\nI'll give this a width of 100% now\nthey're both going to be equal.\n\nThey're not 100% but they're\ntrying to be equal in size.\n\nSo if I shrink that down,\n\nthey'll match in size.\n\nIf I grow them bigger,\n\nthey'll match in size.\n\nAnd again,\n\nit's the red box,\n\nnot the image itself right now.\n\nSo that's one way we can do it.\n\nBut what happens if I want this one\nto be 60% and that one to be say\n\n40% or something like that,\n\nwe can definitely do that.\n\nIt's not difficult to do.\n\nWhat we can do is instead of saying a\nwidth of 100% I can give this a width\n\nof I'm going to make it really small,\n\n30% oops,\n\ndon't want quotation marks there,\n\n30% and it's going to go to 30% and\nthen I can come onto here and I can give\n\nthis a 30% and it's going to listen to me.\n\nRemember,\n\nideally they try and shrink\nto the smallest they can,\n\nbut if they have more content though,\n\nremember when they were both at 100% now\nthis goes back to when we first looked\n\nat Flexbox and how it works when they're\nboth at 100% they were trying to take\n\nup all the available space,\n\nbut they sold the smoosh\nnext to each other,\n\nso they shrank to be\nable to fit into that.\n\nGiven the given space they had.\n\nNow that we've said 30%\nthis is the ideal size.\n\nIf they can be 30% they will be.\n\nSo at bigger screen sizes they're\ngoing to sit at 30% the only time,\n\nyou know,\n\nhere we get lots of issues\nat the small screen sizes,\n\nbut that's fine.\n\nObviously we don't want\nsomething like this though.\n\nSo what we could do is we could say\nthis is actually at 60% and this is at\n\n30% and hit save.\n\nAnd now we get a nice even\ndistribution between the two.\n\nBut we do have some\nleftover space over here,\n\nright order.\n\n[inaudible] [inaudible]\nsolid green [inaudible]\n\noops.\n\nif I use my dev tools just to come in\nreally fast cause we have padding on all\n\nof this.\n\nThere we go.\n\nso you can see there's the container.\n\nSo if I just come here fast,\n\nif I do container [inaudible]\na three border is three pixels\n\nsolid green.\n\nWe have empty space leftover here because\nwe have my 60% and my 30% so we have\n\n10% that's leftover.\n\nSo there's two ways to create that gap.\n\nI could do it with margin.\n\nSo here I could say margin,\n\nwhoops.\n\nMargin,\n\nright?\n\nIs 10% and so now I have 60 70 80\n\n9,100 I know it's using up all the space\nand I have a layout that's going to\n\nwork and again,\n\nit is responsive.\n\nIt's going to work at\ndifferent screen sizes.\n\nWe are running an issues at small sizes.\n\nWe're going to be taking a look at\nmedia queries to fix this next week.\n\nFor the moment though,\n\nI just want you to give you an\noverview of how Flexbox works.\n\nwhat I would use instead of a margin,\n\nright?\n\nBecause then if I decide that this should\nactually be 65 then I'd have to come\n\nhere and change this one too.\n\nSo I'm always,\n\nyou don't,\n\nyou'd be bouncing back and forth if ever\nyou're making adjustments to try and\n\nmake something look perfect.\n\nSo instead of that,\n\nI'm going to remove there\nand I'm a hero itself.\n\nWhat I'm going to add\n\nis,\n\nand normally you'd see this,\n\nI'm going to,\n\nI'll just put the display\nflex here on the hero,\n\neven though I added the row originally.\n\nUh Oh,\n\nthat's my container.\n\nSo on my row,\n\nand I won't always have this on a row,\n\nbut it'd be really common.\n\nwhenever you have a display flex,\n\nyou can choose how things are going\nto be distributed with having a\n\njustify content.\n\nSo justify content is all about just\nspacing out and justifying the space in\n\nbetween things.\n\nSo the default is start.\n\nSo start means they're stuck\ntogether just like this.\n\nit's not start either,\n\nit's going to be flex start,\n\nso they're stuck together there.\n\nIf I change that to a\n[inaudible] and start,\n\nif I change that to flex end,\n\nit's going to put the\nempty space on this side.\n\nInstead,\n\nif I do a center,\n\nit's going to center them and let's just\nshrink one of these down a little bit\n\nso we can see that we have a little\nbit of empty space there and some empty\n\nspace on that side.\n\nSo that's justified content center,\n\nwe'll center it and one\nof a couple others we\n\nhave.\n\nAnd if you're using a code editor,\n\nyou should see all of these\npopping up automatically.\n\nSo justify content.\n\nwe have space and there's space evenly.\n\nSpace around and space between space\nbetween is the one you'll probably use the\n\nmost often.\n\nIt's the only one I'm going\nto worry about before.\n\nNow what space between means is take\nall the space and put it in between your\n\nitems and you can do this if you\nhad 10 items as well and it would,\n\nit would put all the space in between,\n\nbut it would make sure that the left\nmost item is all the way the left and the\n\nright most item is all\nthe way to the right.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo I can have my percentage\nfor my hero here.\n\nmy hero text is 55.\n\nIf I need to be 65 I change it.\n\nI don't have to worry about finicking\naround with margins or spacing or anything\n\nelse like that.\n\nI can easily just leave it where it's\nwherever I am declaring my display\n\nflex,\n\nI'm going to have a justify content.\n\nAnd having a justified\ncontent space between on a\nrow makes a lot of sense to me\n\nwith just how they work.\n\nSo I'm going to leave it just like that.\n\nSo here we have my 65 and then 30.\n\nAnd if I wanted to again I\ncould adjust this 25 and it's\n\nworking out fantastically and I think\nI'll bring that back up to like a 32 or\n\nsomething.\n\nSo my image is a bit bigger.\n\nTurn off my borders.\n\nUh,\n\nwhere's my red border?\n\nMy green one.\n\nWe don't need that at all.\n\nHit save and you know,\n\nwhile we're here\n\n[inaudible]\n\nmargin top of zero and it\naligned them up a little bit\n\nnicer.\n\nSo what you could do now\nis come in and [inaudible]\n\nhere we go.\n\nI'm going to actually do that.\n\nJust have a bit more space there and\nat bigger screen sizes it should look a\n\nlittle bit better.\n\nThere we go.\n\nSo I think that's working out pretty well.\n\nThe big takeaway from this video is cause\nI did look at a few different things\n\ntoday.\n\nUm,\n\nso the,\n\nthe big takeaways from today,\n\ncause we did look at a\nfew different things.\n\nWe looked at this weird aligned self.\n\nWe looked at the justified content.\n\nUm,\n\nthere are quite a few different things\nthat we could take a look at to really\n\nmake sure that we're understanding this.\n\nBut what I really want you to remember\nfor today is I have my container which is\n\nalso a row,\n\nso that means it's a display flex that\nmeans this is one column and this is my\n\nother column right here.\n\nWhether the image is in its own\ndiv or you have this on there,\n\nit's going to be all good.\n\nThis does require you,\n\nif you do it this way,\n\nto have the aligned self flex start\nor else my image is going to try\n\nand stretch that whole height\nwhich makes it look terrible.\n\nSo that is what the aligned self is for\nis just to make sure that it stays only\n\nat the top and retains\nits natural dimensions.\n\nIf we're assigning widths,\n\nas long as the widths\nare smaller than 100%,\n\nit is going to leave us some\nempty space along the way.\n\nSo what we can do with that empty space,\n\nif we can control that empty space\nwith flex by using our justify content,\n\njustify contact is on the main axis,\n\nwhich is horizontal in this case,\n\nand we can do the flex start to flex\nend a center or there's a few different\n\nspace options space between being the\none you probably use the most often and\n\nthat will help justify the content or\nspace that'll help redistribute empty\n\nspace between your different flex items.\n\nThis will only work if your\npercentages are smaller than\n\n100% for their widths.\n\nIf everything is at 100% there's\nno space left to distribute.\n\nSo this only works if there\nis empty space available.\n\nSo what I'm going to be doing is actually\ngiving you this for the challenge,\n\nbut without the image here.\n\nSo you have to bring the image back in\nat a little bit of the code that you see\n\nJust to use that

Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So this image right now,\n\nas I mentioned,\n\nis responsive.\n\nSo if I open up my responsive mode here\nand I can see that it is growing and\n\nshrinking,\n\nbut this is exactly like when we had\nthose three columns of text where even\n\nthough they wanted to be bigger,\n\nthey weren't and they were shrinking\nand growing because the way flex works.\n\nSo just to show you what I mean,\n\nI'm actually going to come back\nhere and do the div class of\n\nzero image.\n\nI'm going to put that on the div\ninstead of on the image itself.\n\nWe're going to go back to that solution\nthat I showed you where we have a div,\n\nthat's the flex parent.\n\nAnd then we have,\n\nor the flex item I should say,\n\nand then we have the image\nthat's inside of there.\n\nAnd at first everything looks like it's\nworking and everything is completely\n\nfine.\n\nBut if we come over,\n\nuh,\n\nlet's on my hero image,\n\nlet's just give that the border again,\n\norder four pixels solid\nred just so we can see it.\n\nso we can see that things are growing\nand shrinking and it's not the end of the\n\nexcept we're actually going to\nget some side scrolling here.\n\nMy image is going to\noverflow out the side.\n\nUh,\n\nthere we go.\n\nWe can see it.\n\nThey're shooting out the side.\n\nThe reason for this is,\n\num,\n\nmy image isn't going to automatically\nshrink because it's not a flex item\n\nanymore.\n\nSo one thing that I do on pretty\nmuch every site that I do,\n\nhere in my sort of generic markup\nthat I always have is to say images,\n\nselect all of them and just give them\na max width 100% and hit save on that.\n\nAnd now all my images\nwill always be responsive.\n\nThey will never grow bigger\nthan their original size,\n\nbut they will always be able to shrink\ndown if their parent is trying to shrink\n\nand fit into a smaller space.\n\nSo a nice,\n\neasy,\n\nsimple step you can do to always ensure\nthat your images do fit on the page\n\nproperly.\n\nI never cause you any overflowing or\nside scrolling or anything like that.\n\nWe've got one more video to go,\n\nwhere we're going to just look\nat how we can control the size,\n\ncontrol the sizes in here\nin a little bit more detail.\n\nAnd then after that,\n\nit is onto you doing the,\n\nand then after that,\n\nyou'll be moving on to the challenge.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/261733-day-9-a-deeper-dive-into-flexbox/755446-ensuring-the-image-is-responsive?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required

Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So let's take a look at the solution\nwhere we want to add in the content area\n\nhere, as well as a sidebar. And this\nis where we're starting from now.\n\nI know I removed the image and\nasked you to put it back in, but if,\n\nsince I've already covered\nthat in a previous lesson,\n\nI'm not going to do it again. So we're\nstarting here with my image in place.\n\nAnd, uh, what I've also done here is I\nhaven't put any content inside of it yet,\n\nbut I've created a main and inside\nmy main I've well, first of all,\n\nI've given a class of Maine.\nYou might say that is redundant,\n\nbut as much as possible in my CSS,\n\nI do like to select things by\nclass rather than by elements,\n\nexcept for some very generic\nstuff all the way at the top,\n\nlike my links and my headings and\nthe body and stuff like that. Um,\n\nso I am going to call it\nmain if you just, you know,\n\neven if that's a did with a class\nof Maine, you could do that.\n\nNow I have given this a main and you'll\nsee how I have my section primary for\n\nthis content. And then\nin the side as a sidebar,\n\nthis could also very well be an article.\nUm, but since we can't really see what,\n\nyou know, we don't have much,\num, information on what this is.\n\nSo I am going to leave it as a section\njust because we're actually getting some\n\ncontext for our site now. So, because\nthings are falling into context,\n\nI thought it would be a good idea to\nuse a bit more semantic, HTML, um,\n\ndibs will work, but it's always\na good idea when possible,\n\nespecially to have a\nmain on your website. Uh,\n\nit helps to note a for accessibility\nreasons. It helps to note a,\n\nthe main content and it is a\nlandmark region on the website.\n\nSo it can make navigating a website\neasier for people that are using\n\naccessibility tools,\num, here on my section.\n\nSo my section would be this part here.\n\nAnd then my aside would be that part here.\n\nAnd you can see I'm sitting at my main\nbecause I want it to be all of that\n\ncontent. So it's the main content of my\nwebsite. The section is just my main,\n\nmy primary content. And then\nI have my aside as a sidebar,\n\nasides are always information\nthat's relevant to something,\n\nbut sort of tangentially related. So\nit's not the main information. Um,\n\nsometimes this could\neasily also just be a div.\n\nIt really depends on the\nsituation, um, that you're doing,\n\njust because it's a sidebar. It doesn't\nnecessarily mean it is in the side. Um,\n\nit depends on the\nrelationship between things.\n\nThe aside could also be inside my section.\n\nI don't want to get too\ncomplicated on that though.\n\nWe're more worried about setting up\nour layouts than we are about, um,\n\nsemantic code at this point.\n\nSo the last thing I'll say on that is\nit's better to use the right tag if you\n\nknow it,\n\nbut if you're not sure it's better to\nput a div than putting the wrong tag.\n\nSo if you're really not sure\nusing a div, um, can work,\n\nbut as you grow as a developer looking\nand looking up and understanding\n\nthe meaning of these and how to properly\nuse them would be a very good thing to\n\ndo because we don't want just everything\nalong the way to be a diff. So, uh,\n\nlet's get into here. What\nI'm going to do is, uh,\n\nreally quickly just bring in the\ncontent. And, um, so here we have, my,\n\nI'm gonna give this an\nage to do the class of,\n\nI don't want to go the here at my\ntexts, Emma H when a paragraph, um,\n\nI'm going to give this a class,\n\nbut I don't want it to be something\nthat's too like primary content header,\n\nbecause everything with this, and\nthis are exactly the same, except for,\n\nexcept for the color of them.\nUm, so even this could be just,\n\nyou know, we could call\nthis, um, I guess subtitle,\n\nand then I have just two paragraphs.\nSo a paragraph and a paragraph,\n\nactually, I don't really\nlike, um, subtitle. I think\nI'm going to call it. Um,\n\nI'm going to call it a section\ntitle and then here in my sidebar,\n\nbecause we're going to need those to be\nhere. I'm going to have that age too.\n\nAnd I'm going to call that one side\nbar title and you'll see why when I get\n\nthere and then we have a paragraph,\n\nand then we're just going to have\nthat if you times. So one, two, three,\n\nand I'm going to fast forward\nwhile I put in all the content.\n\nCause you don't want to just\nsee me copying and pasting text.\n\nAnd then after that,\n\nwe'll look at how I would set up\nmy layout to look like this. Okay?\n\nSo all my content is in place. And\none thing I want to talk about before,\n\nanything else is if I opened my\ndev tools here and we opened this,\n\nsomething to refresh back from the very\nearly lessons is while it's terrible,\n\nbecause everything's touching\nthe side of my screen.\n\nRemember what we've created now is\nperfectly responsive and working at all\n\nscreen sizes right now.\n\nSo this is something that's going\nto come a lot more next week.\n\nCause just remember when we\nstart looking at media queries,\n\nbecause remember what we're about\nto do now is actually going to break\n\nour site a little bit. It's small\nscreen sizes, just like here,\n\nthings aren't working really well.\n\nWe actually run into a lot of problems\nwhere weird stuff starts happening here.\n\nSo we've broken a little bit. Now\nit's responsive in that it's resizing,\n\nbut we've run into issues. So just\nsomething to think about as we keep going.\n\nAnd before we lead into next week,\n\nremember we always start with\na responsive website. Uh,\n\nbut for now I'm going to turn\nthat off and come back down.\n\nNow there's a few different\nways we could approach this.\n\nIf you came in here and did a, um,\n\ncontainer and then wrapped\nall of this stuff inside a\n\ncontainer, that would be perfectly\nfine because what would that do?\n\nThat's going to separate everything\nout like that or not separate,\n\nbut hold everything in the middle\nof the screen, just like that.\n\nAnd we do get the added\nbenefit along the way of that,\n\nof it does have the max\nwidth already set on there.\n\nSo everything will be working.\nIt's going to shrink down.\n\nIt is perfectly responsive. Check\nthat out. We have a responsive,\n\nmain section of our website. Um, so\nI think I might leave it like that.\n\nIf you came and put your\ncontainer up here on the main,\n\nthat would also work if you did. Um,\nif you wanted more of a flat markup,\n\nwe could have a main container like that.\n\nAnd now it's working exactly the\nsame way. It's my main content,\n\nbut it's also a container.\n\nThat's holding everything in the middle\nof the screen and we want it to have the\n\nflex. So we could also make this a row\nand it's giving us our two columns.\n\nNow, remember it's doing two\ncolumns because we look here,\n\nI'm going to collapse my code down.\n\nRemember that whenever\nyou do a display flex,\n\nwhich row is equal to display\nflex in our CSS right now,\n\nI it's taking by default.\n\nIt's going to take the direct\nchildren and turn those into columns.\n\nSo as soon as I said row, it's going\nokay, there we go. I have one column here,\n\none column here.\n\nAnd you'll notice that this one\nalready is bigger than that one.\n\nEven though we haven't\nsaid anything, once again,\n\nit's the quantity of text here.\n\nThat's sort of dictating how all this\nis working, which is kind of weird.\n\nAnd it's one of the reasons I don't\nlike leaving default wits on things with\n\nFlexbox is because it can be a little\nbit unpredictable, what happens.\n\nSo let's go over to my style. And um,\n\nI think what I'm going to do here is\nI'm actually gonna take my button.\n\nIt's weird that my button\nstylings all the way down here,\n\nI'm gonna bring it all the way\nup here with my typography stuff.\n\nCause I think that makes more sense.\nSo we have general a bit of typography,\n\nreusable components, reusable\ncomponent, reusable components,\n\nand then we get into some\nmore direct styling. Um,\n\nand then what we could do here is my\nmain we're kind of finished with it.\n\nSo I don't even know if I need to\nselect that, but we did have my, uh,\n\nprimary content so I could\nget my primary content,\n\na width of say a\n\n62%,\n\nnot 82, whoops, 62. And\nright now it's breaking.\n\nWhy is that happening? Why is it?\nIt's definitely not 62. If anything,\n\nit's like 30% maybe. Do you remember?\n\nCan you think of why\nthat might be going on?\n\nSo if you're, if you got it,\nthat's awesome. If you don't,\n\nif you can't figure it out,\nthat's completely understandable.\n\nCause Flexbox is kind of weird, but\nwhat's happened is we've gone and said,\n\nthis is now trying to be 62%. Remember\nthis is trying to get as big as it can.\n\nSo this is pretty much\nset to a hundred percent.\n\nSo this now wants to be\nbigger than this one.\n\nSo it's going to try\nand be bigger than it.\n\nAnd you get these weird results because\nthis doesn't have a Whitsett to it.\n\nIt has the long text.\n\nThat's trying to fit at a hundred percent\nwidth and it's smashing this guy down\n\nto smaller than 62.\n\nSo now we can come in and do my\nsidebar and give that one width of\n\nlet's give that 32% and\nthere we go. Just like that.\n\nEverything starts falling more\ninto line with what we wanted to.\n\nSo now this is actually 62\nand this is actually 32.\n\nWe also have the space that\nwe wanted already in here.\n\nCause if I come up and take a look,\nwhen I had originally set it up,\n\nI'd had my justified content\nspace between if I turn that off,\n\nthey're going to be glued together.\nThere's no gap in between them,\n\nbut because I have my justified content\nspace between, um, but when we do that,\n\nyou can see it's taking that leftover\nspace that was over on this side and\n\nplacing it in the middle. So that's\nthe percentages that are missing. Uh,\n\nand it's actually the percentages\ndown here that are missing. Now.\n\nOne other thing that has come\nup is because we were using,\n\nI use the exact same words that I'd\nset here. You might be going Kevin,\n\nthat's a little bit redundant. So\nif you did something like this,\n\na primary content,\n\nand then you came here and\nyou did a dot sidebar that\n\nwould work perfectly fine as\nwell. So instead of having that,\n\nwe're seeing both of those\nare behaving like that.\n\nBoth of these are behaving like\nthat. That would be completely valid.\n\nAnd if anything, a little bit\nmore efficient in your CSS,\n\nbut if you did it like this, it's\ncompletely fine. At the end of the day,\n\nit's not going to make a big difference.\nUm, just for simplicity sake,\n\nI'm going to leave it like this for now,\n\njust so we can see the\ndifferent styles being set.\n\nAnd because I have a few different styles,\nI do want to set on my sidebar here.\n\nSo the other things we want to\ndo here are a text align center\n\nand we want to do a color of a FFF,\n\nI guess we'll put on there. Okay.\nAnd when we put those on there,\n\nbut I need a background\ncolor on their do background,\n\ncolor of that one right there.\n\nOh no, it wasn't that one. I took the\nwrong color. It should have been, Oh,\n\nI don't even have the color.\n\nLet's see if I can find it at the bottom\nshould be this one. That'd be a one 36,\n\nC 72. And if we come\nand take a look there,\n\nthat looks a little bit better.\n\nI'm also going to come up on\nmy main and on my main, uh,\n\nif you did padding here instead of\nmargin, it wouldn't really matter,\n\nbut I'll set a margin\ntop of three M just to\n\ngive us a space there.\n\nSo it matches a little bit like\nwe have our space right there.\n\nAnd the last thing we need to do is\nchange the color of this. So that one,\n\nI called it section title. I'm actually\ngonna come up for me personally.\n\nI've started organizing all\nmy type are graphy at the top.\n\nSo I tend to prefer doing\nthat. So section and title,\n\nthere is eight seven six two nine eight.\n\nAnd there we go.\n\nWe're starting to come together and\nwe've pretty much created the part of the\n\nlayout that I wanted. A one last\nthing, I guess we could do, sorry.\n\nI'm scrolling all the way back down\nto my sidebar is just to add a bit of\n\npadding on this. And there we\ngo. That looks a little bit,\n\nremember better and remember mixed\nup better. And remember there, um,\n\nremember that one M that I'm sitting\nhere will be equal to 16 pixels because\n\nthat's the font size\nthat we have picked. Uh,\n\nyou could improve this a little bit.\nI didn't set up all my font sizes.\n\nI think they're, Oh, I put the\nwrong color there. Epic the purple,\n\nwhich I didn't even use here. Oh,\nwell, I'm going to leave it like that.\n\nCause it looks a little prettier, but\nobviously if you put the green one,\n\nthat would be great. Um, you\ncan play with the line Heights.\n\nYou can play with the font sizes, a\nfew other things along the way here,\n\nif you wanted to,\n\nbut I'm going to leave it like this\nbecause my main focus really was just on\n\ncreating these two columns.\nSo just to look really fast,\n\nremember we have a sec a main, so we\nhave something that's holding it any,\n\neven if you didn't have a mean, if\nyou just did dip class container,\n\njust to set something\nup, that's holding it.\n\nAnd then you have that as a display flex\nsomehow with a row or any other way.\n\nAnd in there you had to\ndibs or whatever it is.\n\nYou have two elements holding\ncolumn one, column two,\n\nand then all of the content inside\nof those, you are on the right track.\n\nYou're starting to understand\nthe idea of flex box,\n\nwhere it's always going to be the parent.\n\nAnd then the direct children\nare becoming the columns.\n\nThat's really the most\nimportant thing at this point.\n\nAll this other stuff is just\nsome extra sugar on top.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/264954-day-11-using-flexbox-for-a-navigation/766046-flexbox-challenge-2-solution?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1199">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/pjnk21eglg","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT1M33S","name":"02-12 - navigation-challenge.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/cf1f74fe2360f6adbff2f2fd19865995fb4a14aa.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/cc83ed9a8313620ac9994e10d55fa18dd4038904.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/pjnk21eglg","uploadDate":"2020-04-23","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"Alright, so a little\nbit of a mini challenge.\n\nThis one should not be too\nhard to set up. Basically,\n\nwe want to take a navigation, it\nlooks like this and make it look,\n\nsomething like that. Uh, so just\nreally quickly in my markup here,\n\nI have my header, which is this\ndark background area. I have my nav,\n\nwhich is my math class of nav because\nthis is my primary navigation,\n\nwhich generally is found\ninside of a header.\n\nMy UL here making up on ordered list\nof all my items and then all of my\n\nlist items themselves of\nthe class of nav item on it.\n\nAnd if we scroll over a little bit,\n\nwe will see that I have all my links\nand all of those have the knob,\n\nthe class of nav link on them, making\nit very easy to select.

And if so,\n\nyou were right bit easy because that's\nsomething we've been doing ever since\n\nnow, uh, ever since then.\nAnd if we hit save, boom,\n\nthey all just go next to one another.\nNow they're not trying to stretch out.\n\nThey're not trying to fill up as much\nspace as possible because when we make\n\nsomething display flex,\n\nit's trying to shrink down to\nits smallest possible size. So,\n\nuh, actually if I undo that for\na second and on my nav list,\n\nI might have item, I didn't\ndo one here. So nav item,\n\nif I give these a border border\nof we'll do a kind of big one,\n\nthree pixels solid red, just\nso we can really see it.\n\nYou'll notice these are\nblock level elements.\n\nThey are default with a hundred percent.\n\nAnd as soon as I do that display\nflex on here, they just go, boom.\n\nAnd they go next to one another and\nthey go as small as they possibly can.\n\nThat's because the content in these is\nreally short on like these big paragraphs\n\nrude we were dealing with\nbefore. So display flex on there.\n\nIt does most of the work. Now, the next\nthing we want to do is space them out.\n\nSo there's a few different ways we could\nspace them out and what the easiest\n\nway, in my opinion,\n\nto be able to do it would be\non the nav items themselves.\n\nWe could add some margin to the right\nside of them because we always want a\n\nmargin on the right side, the right\nside, the right side, the right side.\n\nAnd here, it doesn't matter too much.\n\nSo if you just took your nap\nitem and you just said margin,\n\nright of, I don't know, let's\nsay 1:00 AM. There you go.\n\nWe get some spacing in between\nthem. We can get rid of that border\n\nand it's looking not too bad.\n\nI'm going to actually make this padding\non these a little bit bigger. Um,\n\njust so it matches my design a\nlittle more and it's not terrible.\n\nNow it is stuck to the side,\nwhich doesn't look very good.\n\nSo that would be in my markup. Uh,\n\nI would tend to come in here and do a dot\n\ncontainer to have a class of container\nwrapping all the way around my nav\n\nhere. Um, I think that's the easiest\nway you could, obviously we've seen,\n\nwe can reuse things in different ways so\nI could put the container right on the\n\nnav itself and that would work as well.\nBut I sort of like doing it like this,\n\nwhere I'm separating the\nconcerns at least a little bit,\n\nsame with your so like that we\nhave a relatively responsive\n\nlayout with a max width on it. And just\nlike that we have it working navigation.\n\nUm, in the next video though,\n\nwe'll look at how we can take this and\nactually push it over to that side,\n\nwhich is sort of more of a realistic\nlayout and the type of thing that you\n\ngenerally see.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/264954-day-11-using-flexbox-for-a-navigation/766019-flexbox-challenge-3-solution?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1305">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/47f4nalk86","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT8M17S","name":"new-nav-01.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/82ed7484a1bfc64b81c61acb05af5922604b5959.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/ea0798f2cd0f1a49722b6eb757199336035e9b21.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/47f4nalk86","uploadDate":"2020-04-23","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"Okay. So right now our navigation looks\nlike this. And over the next few videos,\n\nwhat we're going to be doing is exploring\na few different things we can do where\n\nwe're going to start with this more common\npattern where we get to the sign in,\n\nsign up on the other side, we're\ngoing to go in and add a logo to it.\n\nAnd then we're going to\ncenter this in the middle.\n\nAnd all of this will take a little bit\nof playing around with and exploring how\n\nFlexbox works. And there'll be one\nother little twist along the way,\n\nnot so much in layout, but just in\nhow we can vertically center things.\n\nCause we'll see that that might not\nhappen as we expect it to just start off\n\nwith though,\n\nI want to look at how we can get the sign\nin and sign up to the other side. Now,\n\nthere are some tricky\nways you could do it,\n\nwhere if you are having all of it\nin one list like we currently do.\n\nSo I'm going to show that one just because\nsome people are going to be in worlds\n\nwhere they can access the HTML. It's\na WordPress site. It's something else.\n\nSo you can't actually make any changes\nhere. You're just playing with the CSS.\n\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm for\nthis, just for simplicity's sake,\n\nI'm going to come up to here on my nav\nitem and I'm going to add another class\n\nhere. So the second class\non here, let's say nav item,\n\npush, uh, sorry, double\nhyphen, and then push. Right.\n\nI'm only putting it on this one,\n\ncause this is going to push\neverything over to the right.\n\nAnd this is a fun thing to\nknow about how CSS works. Um,\n\nso we do know that let's go to,\n\nwe're going to go all the way back up\nto something we did a long time ago with\n\nmy container.\n\nAnd we know when we set a width on\nsomething and we give it a margin of zero\n\nauto it centers, but when we're giving\nsomething, the margin of zero auto,\n\num, that is centering it on the page.\n\nAnd I think we'll see it a\nbit more clearly here because\nit's the auto left and\n\nauto writer centering it.\n\nBut if ever you do a\nmargin only left of auto,\n\nit's actually gonna push that all\nthe way to the right and see it here.\n\nEverything's getting pushed all the way\nto the right side because the margins\n\nare getting applied only to the left.\nAnd when we do the margin, right,\n\nand the margin left auto, it\nends up actually centering it.\n\nSo one way we could achieve\nthis layout is by coming\n\nstill in our CSS. Uh,\n\nso I have my nav item\nwill come in and do my nav\n\nitem and then we'll do a,\nwhat was it? Push left?\n\nAnd we can use the exact\nsame thing margin left.\n\nAnd of course it would work\nif I put the right thing,\n\nI'm not pushing it to the left,\nI'm pushing it to the right,\n\nwhich is the name that I'd originally\ngiven. It, it save. And there we go.\n\nNow it's actually pushing all\nthe way to the right side.\n\nSo that is nice and handy, I think,\nand very useful to know how to do.\n\nI don't know if I would always do\nsomething like that though. Uh,\n\nso I do want to show you some,\n\nanother approach to that is probably that\nfrom my experience has been much more\n\ncommon to see in the real\nworld. So instead of using that,\n\nwhich works perfectly,\nif you want to do it,\n\nbut it would be to not\nhave this class on here,\n\nbut to actually take these two list\nitems and I'm going to do a cut on those.\n\nSo I'm going to remove them from\nmy list. Let's hit save on this,\n\nlet me do that. They disappeared.\n\nAnd I'm going to come in and do\na second UL here called nav list.\n\nCause it's what it is. And on there,\nwe can put these into that one instead.\n\nSo right now we ended up with two\nnav lists. Um, inside your nav,\n\nyou can have dibs, you can have spans,\n\nyou can have as much stuff\nas you want in here. Really.\n\nIt doesn't have to be only\nlists that are inside of a nav.\n\nThe important thing with your NAB is\nthat it is the primary navigation.\n\nNow what I might do on\nthese two is give them,\n\nyou could also technically\nseparate this into two NAB tags.\n\nIf you really wanted to, I'm not\ngoing to do that in this case,\n\nbut the first one could be\nconsidered a primary navigation.\n\nAnd the second one down here\ncould be a secondary one.\n\nYou would want to look into the\narea rules on how to set that up.\n\nIf you're using multiple nav elements.\n\nSo now we have an element and that\nelement has to direct children on it.\n\nSo can you think of a way to bring\nthis all the way over to the other side\n\nthere, I'm not going to make this a\nchallenge. I just want to, you know,\n\nhow could we do that? It's something we've\nbeen doing a lot with Flexbox so far.\n\nSo think about it. I just gave\nyou a little bit of a clue.\n\nYeah. The clue was to use\nFlexbox to be able to do it.\n\nSo let's go and open up my style.\n\nAnd what I'm going to do\nhere is we call it my nav.\n\nSo I'm just going to get my nap and let's\ngive this a border border, two pixels,\n\nsolid yellow.\n\nSo we can see where it is just like that\nwith all this empty space over here.\n\nNow on my nav, if I do, or actually\nbefore I do that, let's say my nav list.\n\nLet's give those borders to\nborder two pixels, solid red.\n\nAnd when you're learning, giving things\nborders, or even background colors.\n\nSo I like borders because\nit sort of highlights.\n\nIt can be a really good way to learn and\nI'm going to make the red ones a little\n\nbit bigger so we can\nsee them a bit clearer.\n\nAnd so we have these two here that\nare direct children to my yellow box.\n\nSo as soon is I take my yellow box. As\nsoon as it has a display flex on it,\n\nthey go next to one and\nnext to one another,\n\ninstead of being one on top of each\nother, we've made our two columns.\n\nIt's come back to here for a second.\n\nWe have my flex parent and the\ndirect children are becoming\n\ncolumns inside of that flex\nparent, just like here,\n\nthis is also a flex parent. So this\nis a flex item now and a flex parent.\n\nSo each one of these is becoming a\ncolumn inside of this flex parent,\n\nwhich is a flex item of this flex parent.\n\nSo we're getting a little\nbit of flex box inception,\n\nflex suction going on right here. Um,\n\nnow we don't want them to be\nstuck to each other like this.\n\nWe actually want this one to be\nmoved all the way over to that side.\n\nSo for that,\n\nthen we could use my justify\ncontent space between,\n\nand you remember when I said that would\nbe the one that we'd be using the most\n\noften, it's probably the most useful\nout of all of them. So just like that,\n\nthey get spread out from one\nside all the way to the other.\n\nNow you will be noticing there is an\nissue here where we have some extra space\n\nhere.\n\nThat's coming up because I\ndid my margin right on my nav\n\nitems. So every nav item has\na margin on the right side,\n\nwhich is creating an\nempty space there. Uh,\n\nwe could fix this by using that\ntrick and have item plus nav\n\nitem and just switching\nthat from emerging,\n\nright to a margin left. And I think\nit would solve all our problems.\n\nSo this is exactly like that\ncall plus call thing that we did.\n\nSo it's not selecting this one, but it\nis selecting him and it is selecting him.\n\nAnd actually, let's see if I can change\nsomething on these. Uh, let's give them,\n\nlet's give those like a font size of two\nM just so they get really big so we can\n\nsee it's not selected in the first one,\n\nbut it is selecting these two and\nit's not selecting the first one,\n\nbut it is selecting my\nbutton. So remember,\n\nthis is selecting any nav item\nthat has a item before it.\n\nSo it's not selecting both of them.\n\nIt's only this nav item\nthat had one before it.\n\nSo does this one have one before\nit? Nope. Doesn't get selected.\n\nDoes this one have one before? It,\nit does. Okay. It's going to change.\n\nDoes this one have one before\nit? Yes. It's going to change.\n\nIt's only doing that within the here.\n\nSo this one has one before it,\nbut it's nested somewhere else.\n\nSo that's why this one here, which is\nmy signing. Isn't getting selected.\n\nIt's looking within here. Is there\nan ally before this? Nope. Okay.\n\nWe're not selecting you. Is\nthere one before this? Yes. Okay.\n\nWe can select you and increase your font\nsize if you're not too convinced with\n\nthat one.\n\nThe other one you could do is give each\none of these a different class and then\n\nselect them separately. A two, this one\ncould have margin only on the right.\n\nThis one could have\nmargin only on the left.\n\nAnd then that would also work perfectly.\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nWe can come down and take off my\nborder and take off this border\n\nand hit save.\n\nAnd we're starting to fall in line or\nwe've pretty much fallen in line with this\n\nfirst one here at the top.\n\nSo that's it for this\none in the next video,\n\nwe're going to look at how we can\nbring the logo in. And then finally,\n\nwe'll look at one of the other popular\ndesign patterns where we have something a\n\nlittle bit like that.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/266333-day-12-getting-fancy-with-navigations/770946-fancier-up-our-navigation-with-flexbox?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1358">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/827mjuszis","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT10M49S","name":"new-nav-02.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/5e1b48e22bcdfe8d001685123250d740a92204ae.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/76ce347dfd95d987ebba14a4858db6cd7c32bf94.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/827mjuszis","uploadDate":"2020-04-23","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So I'm going to bring in the logo now\nand I'm going to be bringing it in right\n\nhere before my navigation, even though\nit is something I could click on,\n\nit's going to be a link that\nbrings me home. I find it a bit.\n\nIt doesn't make sense\nto me to have the nav,\n\nhave two links going to the homepage.\n\nSo that's the reason I'm going\nto bring it in over here. Uh,\n\nthink of it as a screen reader,\nthe nav becomes a landmark.\n\nSo someone on a screen reader\ncould find the nav really easily.\n\nAnd then if they're cycling through,\nthey're going to get home and home.\n\nIt's a little bit bizarre. So I'm\ngoing to bring in my logo right here.\n\nSo I'm just gonna do an HRF is equal\nto nothing. And inside that link,\n\nwe can do our image SRC. I'm going\nto give this image to you as well.\n\nAlt can be conquering,\nresponsive layouts. Um,\n\nI've done it as an SVG.\n\nThere's different ways to worry\nabout SVGs and do SVG stuff,\n\nbut we're just going to do it just\nlike that. Um, so if we look here,\n\nwe have this on top and then we have the\nnavigation stuff all coming underneath.\n\nHow can we make that a\nall go next to each other?\n\nHopefully you're thinking display,\nflex, and exactly you can.\n\nWhere does it need to go? Well,\nI want this to be one column.\n\nI want that to be another column.\nSo I'm going to have two columns.\n\nI can do that in my\ncontainer. So I'm a container.\n\nWhy don't I just use that row class that\nwe've been using over and over and over\n\nagain?\n\nSo my container and the row remember is\njust equal to display flex and I'm going\n\nto hit save. And before I do, though,\n\nI'm going to give you a few seconds to\nthink about what you think is going to\n\nhappen. So here we go,\n\nI'm going to hit save. And it was that\nyou're expecting, I bet you, it wasn't.\n\nSo this is a bit of a good\nreminder on how Flexbox works.\n\nSo let's come over to my styles here\nand just make everything red or not red,\n\nbut we're going to give everything\na border. So my nav here,\n\nwhich is all of this stuff is\ngoing to get a border of two\n\npixels solid bread.\n\nAnd you can see that it's shrunk down\nto as small as it possibly can be.\n\nAnd there's another issue\nwhere it's not actually eco,\n\neverything's pushed up to the top and\nit's not matching the height of this. Um,\n\nso everything's getting pushed\nover here. And so, you know,\n\none thing people might say is it's,\n\nit's getting pushed over there cause we\ndid have the space between honor row.\n\nSo just to show you that it's not\nactually that that's causing the issue\n\ncompletely. Um, if I turn that\noff, it's sticking over here.\n\nAnd the first thing I'm going to do is\nactually I'm going to leave the red box\n\non actually, but I want to see how\nright now, um, if I turn off, I said,\n\nI wasn't going to, but let's just\nturn that off for a second. See what,\n\nlike the space underneath is much\nbigger than the space on top. Um,\n\nso the very first thing actually I'm\ngoing to do before I get this to be fixed.\n\nAnd before we explore that is just\nto get this centered this way. Um,\n\nlet's actually go and take a look at\nthere's a few different ways we can\n\nactually solve this problem. One of them\ncould be directly on the row itself.\n\nUh, but just cause I don't want,\n\nI think that's going to cause\nproblems everywhere else.\n\nSo I don't want to do it there.\n\nSo where I'm going to do it is here\nwhere we have my nav list and we've done\n\ndisplay flex here. So on this nav\nlist, um, let's give this one,\n\nthe border now border two pixels\nsolid red. So when we look at that,\n\nwe have our nav list that\nwe created earlier. Um,\n\nand we can see that they're\nstretching to match that whole height,\n\nbut that's a little bit of an\nissue because they're stretching,\n\nbut their children aren't stretching\nlike the Texas stuck to the top of those.\n\nAnd this is something you'll run\ninto a lot of the time. Luckily, uh,\n\nvertically centering in\nCSS used to be a nightmare,\n\nbut we can find other ways of\nfixing it. So where I display,\n\nwe have a display flex,\n\nI've talked about justified content is\ndoing things on the main access or going\n\nhorizontally. We also\nhave a vertical axis.\n\nThe up and down it's called the cross\naxis. We can switch these axes around.\n\nWe're not worrying about that quite yet.\nWe're going to see that next week. Um,\n\nbut we have the main axis going horizontal\nand the cross axis going up and down\n\njustify content is\nworking on the main axis.\n\nSo it's spacing content out this way.\n\nAnd then the other one we have is the\nalign items or the align self for the line\n\nitems.\n\nIt's going to look at all the direct\nchildren and how do we want to do it?\n\nWe can do a flex start.\n\nI can do a flex end and actually\npush everything down to the bottom.\n\nFlex stark will pull\neverything up to the top.\n\nThat's what we used here\nto pull my image up.\n\nSo it wouldn't stretch all the\nway down or we have a nice,\n\ngood old center. So it's actually going\nto center this inside the logo space.\n\nAnd so you can see that it's now\ncentered that way. So if I turn off this,\n\nwe get it working. It's now\nperfectly centered this way.\n\nNow we just need to space things\nout a little bit again. Uh,\n\nso the first thing I'm actually going\nto do is turn my space between back on.\n\nI want to get this back all the way\nover to that side. So on my row,\n\nyou can turn that back on and then we\njust have to figure out how to get this\n\nguy all the way over to here. How\nare we going to figure it out?\n\nWe're going to put some\nborders on stuff again.\n\nSo I'm going to come on\nmy nav here and on here,\n\nI'm going to give this a border two\npixels solid. We'll go with red again.\n\nNotice how the nav is actually\nreally small. We have, you know,\n\nwe have my nav there and I have\nthe other one, which is my logo.\n\nI don't even think I\ngave that a class. Um,\n\nso on this link just for now, so we can\nhighlight it. Class is equal to logo\n\njust so we can come here and\nsee it better. So dot logo,\n\na border two pixels, solid yellow.\n\nSo we can see we have that\nthere. And we have that.\n\nThen we have all this empty\nspace in between. Well,\n\nthat's coming because\nwe, you know, on our row,\n\nwe've used space between in this\ncase, let's go and look here.\n\nCause we know we use the row on the\ncontainer and we had the space between,\n\nso let's take that off and see what\nhappens and everything gets stuck to this\n\nside. So the row is\nstill the full size. Uh,\n\nso border two pixels solid we'll do white.\n\nCause I think it does\nstand out in the green.\n\nSo our row is still this full width here,\n\nbut because we're not using space between\neverything sticking to the beginning,\n\nthis happening because\nwhen we use display, flex,\n\neverything shrinks to the smallest.\n\nIt can be that wasn't happening\nhere because we have these big,\n\nlong paragraphs pushing it bigger.\n\nBut over here where we just have these\ntiny things they can shrink down.\n\nSo we need a way to get this\nto be all the way over here.\n\nSo I'm going to put that back on,\n\nbut we also want it to be\nas big as it can be, right?\n\nBecause when that logo wasn't there\nand we weren't doing all that,\n\nwe had this layout, we had the home\nalready on the side. We had the sign in,\n\nwe had all of that already on that side.\n\nSo we know we need this red box to be\nas big as possible and then the home and\n\nall that's going to be in the right place.\n\nAnd this stuff is going\nto stay there anyway.\n\nSo there's two different\nways you can do it. Um,\n\none way we could do it is just say width\n100% and it's going to try and be a\n\nhundred percent.\n\nSo it's going to try and fill up as much\nspace as it can because of the whole\n\nway display flex works. We know that\neven if something is a hundred percent,\n\nit might not always really\nbe a hundred percent.\n\nIt's just going to try\nand be a hundred percent.\n\nSo it's trying to fill up all that space\nand it just snuggles up right here.\n\nThat is probably the easier one to use,\n\nbut I do want to talk about\nsomething else that's new to Flexbox.\n\nAnd what that is is the way flex\nworks is there's two properties.\n\nThere's a flex grow a property\nand there's a flex trunk.\n\nProperty flux grow doesn't want to grow.\n\nThat's why everything just\nshrinks down to nothing.\n\nSo flex shrink is set to one,\n\nmeaning things will shrink\nand flex grow is set to zero.\n\nMeaning they're not going to grow up.\n\nThey're going to just be as\nsmall as they possibly can be.\n\nIt's a little bit more complex than that,\n\nbut that's probably the easiest\nway to understand it at this point.\n\nSo this is sort of like disabling\ngrowing and enabling drinking.\n\nAnd this is why when things are\nbigger than they have to be,\n\nthey can shrink and fit. What\nwe can do though is on my nav.\n\nI could set this to a one, so I'm going\nto allow it to grow and then it's,\n\nand then it's going to work. So let's\nput that to zero and hit save actually.\n\nSo it shrinks back down and then we put\nthe one here and it's going to allow it\n\nto grow.\n\nWhat the shrink on here means is that\nit's allowed to shrink and it's allowed to\n\ngrow. So let's set a width of, I'm\ngoing to put a hard value in here,\n\n700 pixels, and I'm going\nto turn off flex grow.\n\nWe'll put that to zero. So that's\nexactly 700 pixels now. Exactly.\n\nBut we know with Flexbox that\nthings will adapt in size.\n\nSo this is why by default flex\nshrink is on. Cause if it wasn't,\n\nwe'd have some problems. So here\nlet's turn on responsive mode.\n\nAnd if it's bigger than that, we\nhave 700. And if I go smaller,\n\nit's willing to shrink.\nSo 700 is the ideal size,\n\nbut because my grow is set to zero,\n\nwhich is the default and my shrink\nis set to one. It wants to be 700.\n\nIt is stay at 700, unless I go smaller.\n\nIf I put my shrink to zero, it's\ngoing to turn off shrinking though.\n\nAnd what that means is it's going\nto be 700 and it's going to be 780.\n\nIt's actually crushing my logo into\nnon-existence and then it's causing\n\noverflowing. So flex shrink at zero.\n\nI don't know when you're\nactually would want to use that.\n\nMaybe there's some times, but it's\nprobably going to be pretty rare. Um,\n\nyou also, probably, if you are using it,\n\nyou probably wouldn't be using\nit with an absolute value.\n\nYou'd probably be using it\nwith a percentage instead.\n\nSo I'm not actually going\nto apply a width on here.\n\nI'm not going to have\na flex shrink of zero,\n\ncause this is pretty handy and I'm\ngoing to enable my flex grow to be\n\none. And that means it's going to try\nand be as big as it possibly can be.\n\nIt sort of ignores the width a little\nbit. Once you have a grow of one on there,\n\njust cause it's always going to try and\nbe as big as it can possibly be rather\n\nthan only trying to shrink\nas much as possible.\n\nSo we don't need these two lines\nanymore. I can get rid of those. Now,\n\nif you're not too sure about this,\ndon't worry too much about it.\n\nIt is a little strange. Um,\n\nit is something that would be good to\nplay around with and to practice a little\n\nbit and see if you can make\nsure you can understand it.\n\nIf you prefer the idea of just using\nwidth 100% for now that would a hundred\n\npercent work and a hundred percent\ngive you the exact same results in a\n\nsituation like this one. So don't\nstress too much about it for the moment.\n\nWhat I'm going to do is turn off all\nthese borders. We don't have that many.\n\nActually we just have\nto find that white one.\n\nAnd the last, last last thing is\ninstead of having a border on my logo,\n\nwe can give this a margin\non the right side of one M\n\nand just like that. We have our layout\nlooking very similar to this one.\n\nAnd for the most part,\n\nit is going to be responsive until they\nsmashed into each other because there's\n\nnot enough room. That is something\nwe'll be looking at fixing next week.\n\nBut for now I think that's looking pretty\ngood. We have this nice navigation,\n\njust like that. The last way\nwanted to get to is this one here?\n\nThis one's a little bit trickier, but\nit's actually a really simple solution.\n\nWe're going to be seeing\nit in the next video.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/266333-day-12-getting-fancy-with-navigations/770951-more-improvements-to-the-navigation?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1411">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ali6204eac","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT2M50S","name":"new-nav-03.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/90ff563fbc81d65f36fd378bc2e6aea1e7d222dd.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/a3ecc4dba3047ec67d980ac337de17a97b55baa9.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ali6204eac","uploadDate":"2020-04-23","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"Okay. So, as I said, this, one's not\nreally a Flexbox solution in term,\n\nit's more of just a layout solution.\nWe are doing responsive layout. So,\n\nyou know, we're not just tying of\nFlexbox here. And so on my nav list here,\n\nwhat I'm going to do is actually\ngive the nav list itself.\n\nA border of two pixels, solid red.\n\nI love my borders and we have two\nof them here, one here and one here,\n\nand I want to get in only\nthis one to be in the middle.\n\nSo the easiest thing to do is to come\nover to HTML and select that one.\n\nSo I'm going to call it nav list primary.\n\nSo that becomes my primary list.\n\nAnd then I have this one over\nhere just for consistency sake.\n\nWe might as well name that one secondary.\n\nAnd I know some people prefer\nseeing code with the word rap off.\n\nI find it really messy right now, but\nwe have our primary list, right? Oops.\n\nA primary list right here. So we\nhave a UL. That's my nav list,\n\nwhich also has the Nablus\nprimary class on it.\n\nAnd then I have my second list\nright here. That is my novelist, ms.\n\nSecond class of Nablus secondary.\nI'm not going to need that for now,\n\nbut if we're putting a primary might\nas well have the secondary on there,\n\njust in case you want to do\nsomething a little fancier with it.\n\nSo here we can do my nav list. Primary.\n\nCause I want to select this one, which\nis the one I want to move. And again,\n\nthis is all Ben with the double underscore\ndouble hyphen. If you don't like it,\n\nyou don't got to like it. It's\nthe way I like doing things.\n\nSo we have the double\nunderscore here just saying,\n\nthis is a modifier class of this.\n\nSo my nebulous it's keeping all of\nthese properties and then we're doing a\n\nslight modification to it.\n\nAnd what the modification\nis going to be in this time.\n\nWhat could I do to get this\nto be right in the middle?\n\nNothing to do with Flexbox since\nsomething else that you already knew,\n\ndo you think of it?\n\nThis one is the same way we move this\nall the way over to the side. Um,\n\nthis is a fun one margin,\nzero auto and boom.\n\nIt goes right in the middle auto margins\nare absolutely amazing. People do,\n\ndefinitely do not push them\nenough. So just like that.\n\nAnd let's turn off that border. We\nhave a nice, perfectly centered one,\n\nright in the middle. It would be\nperfectly centered in this space.\n\nSo this size and this space\nhere will be exactly even, uh,\n\nor maybe they're a little bit off. We\ncould take that margin off of our logo.\n\nAnd then I guess it would\nbe perfectly centered,\n\nbut nice and perfectly functional. So\nthere you have it, a few different ways.\n\nYou can build some navigations using\nFlexbox and just some good old margins.\n\nHope you learned a lot from this.\n\nAnd so I was originally going\nto do a navigation challenge,\n\nbut I decided just to\nshow you this to you guys,\n\ncause I thought this one would be a\nlittle bit frustrating if you couldn't\n\nfigure it out, the auto margin\nthing.

And\nthen we put in some curly braces,\n\nlet me do that. We have the\nbasics of immediate query.\n\nNow I mentioned I can do a\nmedia type and media features.\n\nIf we leave it like this,\n\nwe have obviously nothing over\nhere before we can even, you know,\n\nwe could include the media type here,\nmedia type. If we leave it blank, though,\n\nit means it's targeting all media types\nand you might be wondering what they\n\nare, there's print there's screen.\n\nThere is also a speech media\nqueries that do exist out there.\n\nYou won't see those too often though.\n\nWe don't include a media type\nand we just focus inside here,\n\nwhich is our media features. Since\nthere's a lot of different things,\n\nyou can look for there's things\nlike wits, orient, widths,\n\nor Heights you can look at.\n\nSo that's based on like the actual\nwidth or height of the viewport.\n\nYou can look at orientations,\nis it landscape? Is it portrait?\n\nYou can even look at to see if a feature\nhas the ability to have a hover or not\n\nand different stuff like that. So, uh,\n\nthe one that we're going to be looking\nat the most is just focusing on width and\n\nyou don't actually width because\nthat would be very limiting.\n\nIf you said the width is 600 pixels and\nthe device, you know, um, so in general,\n\nyou're either going to see a min width\nand you could do a minimum width of 600\n\npixels, or you could have a maximum width.\n\nNow this takes a little bit of getting\nused to because you see the word max.\n\nSo you think big, or you put in\nthe word men and you think small,\n\nbut it's actually the opposite because\nif you think you're the minimum,\n\nwidth is 600 pixels. So that\nmeans in minimum of 600 or bigger.\n\nSo anytime you see men\nwidth, this means, uh,\n\n600 pixels or bigger,\n\nand you might get other times\nwhere it's the other way around\n\nand it'd be a max width, 600.\n\nSo that one would be a 600 pixels or\nsmaller that you're targeting. And again,\n\nbecause we haven't included a media type,\n\nthat means it's targeting all media types.\n\nAnd this is generally how\nI write my media queries.\n\nI don't usually include the media type\nunless I would be making immediate query\n\nspecifically for print. In that case,\nit would sort of make sense there.\n\nNow you can actually\ncombine these as well.\n\nSo I could a minimum width\nof 600 and we could do here\n\na max width of 900 pixels.\n\nSo then in this case,\n\nit would literally be looking at creating\na specific one that only works in\n\nbetween those two screen\nsizes. So six to 900.\n\nI don't want to be worrying\nabout things like that for now.\n\nAnd just to give you an idea of how\nit works, I'm here on my example,\n\nI've given, which is my blue\nbox. That's on the screen.\n\nYou've probably guessed that so far. Um,\n\nit has a background of steel\nblue. So if I came on here, now,\n\nwhat I could do is dot\nexample and select it again.\n\nAnd when we're in here, I could change\nmy background, color, background color,\n\nand this is not something I would\never do. A background color will be,\n\nlet's go with something nice. Um, uh,\n\nI want something that's not going to\nburn the eyes too much with all of drab\n\nhere and you can see it's\nactually changed. Now,\n\nif we bring up my dev tools and I,\nuh, shrink this down a little bit,\n\nat one point, it's going\nto switch over to blue.\n\nSo you can see here where it has the\nscreen size is soon as we get to 600 and\n\nthat's the viewport width,\n\nas soon as it crosses that\nit's where it's switching over.\n\nSo it's sticking with this. And then\nwhen I hit a minimum width of 600,\n\nso at 600 pixels or bigger, it's going\nto go to my olive drab. So click,\n\nit goes over. So if we wanted to take\na look at how the max width is working,\n\nrather than the men width, I'm\ngoing to just comment this out.\n\nSo it's not doing anything anymore.\n\nAnd then here we'll put\nin the exact same thing.\n\nAnd actually it's just copy and paste\nto speed things up a little bit.\n\nAnd now you can see the big screen\nsizes. We're still with the default,\n\nbecause now this is\nsaying from a max width.\n\nSo that means from zero until\na maximum width of 600 pixels,\n\nwe are going to do our olive drab.\nSo that means at small screen sizes,\n\nwe have our olive drab and\nthen large screen sizes.\n\nWe're switching over to our steel blue.\n\nSo this way of writing it\nis considered desktop first,\n\nwhere we're worrying\nabout the default styling.\n\nThat's not included in a media query\nis for large screens or desktop screens\n\nand what is included.\n\nAnd then what is included in the media\nquery is for your small screens or\n\nactually should be highlighting\nhere. This is for my small screen.\n\nSo it's from zero to a maximum\nwidth of 600 pixels for now,\n\njust for simplicity sake. We're just\ngoing to stick with one of them.\n\nSo I'll turn that off\nand comment this back on.\n\nSo we can just, so now you can\nsee it's now the other way around.\n\nSo this is the mobile first.\nThese are my mobile styles.\n\nAnd then when we get\nto larger screen sizes,\n\nwe're kicking in and overriding\nthose with new things right there.\n\nAnd for fun, why don't we do another\none? So it's always at media open, close,\n\nopen, close. And then in here,\n\nlet's put in a min width of 800 pixels.\n\nAnd once again, we have\nto select my example\n\nand then we can put a background\ncolor, okay, let's go with an orange,\n\norange red looks pretty\nnice. Let's go with that.\n\nAnd so now we should start with the\nblue at the smallest screen size,\n\nmove up to our olive drab and then\nmove up to our orange red there.\n\nanother thing that's really important\nbefore we finish off this lesson is just\n\nthat it's keeping all of these properties\nhere. So it's keeping the width,\n\nit's keeping the, my margin.\nIt's keeping my padding.\n\nIt's only overwriting the color here.\nNow, the other thing that's really,\n\nreally important.\n\nWe really need the order of these is\nreally important because say I came here\n\nand I did background color\nsteel blue, and then I said,\n\nbackground color is purple.\n\nWell at the smallest screen size,\nit's going to be purple. Right? Um,\n\nI'm sure you, you knew that, uh,\nbecause it's looking at this first,\n\nit's looking at that second,\nthe second rule is going to win.\n\nSo because I am dealing\nwith a minimum width here.\n\nSo it's going from that within bigger. Um,\n\nif I move this underneath\nthat media query,\n\nuh, my orange red can never win.\n\nSo we're going to go right from purple\nto the drab green because this and here\n\nwill go bigger, even. So it's going\nfrom a minimum width of 800 pixels.\n\nWe want to be orange red,\n\nbut from a minimum width of 600\npixels and 800 is bigger than 600.\n\nThis one here is going to\nwin. And it's the same thing.\n\nIf I brought all of this up here, then\nnone of those are ever going to win.\n\nThe purple's always going to win\nbecause there is no condition for it.\n\nNo matter what the condition\nis, that is always applying.\n\nSo the order that you put things\nin is very, very important.\n\nSo if you're dealing with minimum widths,\n\nit's always going to be from smallest\nto biggest inside your media queries\n\nso they can overwrite when it,\nso they can override each other.\n\nAs we grow to bigger screen sizes,","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/269778-day-15-intro-to-media-queries/779593-media-query-basics?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1570">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tl808k3cpq","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT4M31S","name":"03-02.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d63f078898055f065b5facd25fc87db1ad9b727a.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/15035b792b464c3fd6b3e3af5fe916f9130534e9.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/tl808k3cpq","uploadDate":"2020-04-27","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So let's say we want to take our existing\nsite right now and we want to make\n\nthis actually responsive.\n\nSo I'm going to look at this area here\nfirst and let's shrink it down and see,\n\nwell, what the problem is.\nSo when I shrink that down,\n\nobviously things are getting too small.\nI don't really want this to happen.\n\nI'd rather everything just stacks, because\nthis, this is kind of awkward. Right?\n\nUm, so if we look down here at the\nmarkup of it, we have my hero text,\n\nand then I have the image. So how could\nwe do that with a media query? Well,\n\nlet's come down and in\ngeneral, I'm going to suggest,\n\njust placing all your media\nqueries down at the bottom.\n\nSo they are overwriting\nthings because, um, you know,\n\nas we saw the order is very important\nand then you can keep everything grouped\n\ntogether. It'd be a little bit easier.\n\nYou could also group it with the elements\nthemselves. Uh, but it's in general,\n\nunless you're using a preprocessor\nlike sass or something. Um,\n\nyou generally find all the media queries\ngrouped together most of the time. Um,\n\nit really depends though.\nI do. I'm used to SAS,\n\nso I often end up grouping\nthings with their elements,\n\nbut it depends how you'd like to work.\n\nI'm going to use the media query of\nabout, we'll say 600 pixels for now,\n\nhow I'm coming up with 600 pixels.\n\nThat's going to be any future lesson\nwhere I'm going to talk a little bit about\n\nthat. But for now, what I'm gonna do is\ncome in and rate immediate query. Now,\n\none thing we have to do is decide,\n\nare we writing a minimum width or\nmax with media query in general,\n\nwhat we've done now is\nsomething called desktop first,\n\nwhere we're starting\nwith a desktop design,\n\nand then we're going to figure out the\nmobile one afterward because we already\n\ndid all of our desktop stuff.\nAnd from my experience,\n\nthis is what most people do. So\nto do that, I would do at media\n\nopening, close curly, or parentheses,\nthen opening, close curly.\n\nWe can re max width of 600\npixels. And if you remember,\n\nif we go back to my HTML for a second,\n\nyou remember we used our row to\nactually make columns. So in here,\n\nI'm going to come in here and say that\nmy dot row, uh, to make it do columns.\n\nIf you remember originally\nwe did display flex on it.\n\nI don't want that flex behavior anymore.\nI want it to go back to stacking.\n\nSo here,\n\nwhat I'm going to do is a display of\nblocks are gonna overwrite what we'd\n\noriginally done and set it\nto be a display, a block.\n\nRemember I'm using max width here.\n\nSo that means from zero up\nto 600 pixels display block.\n\nAnd we'll hit save on that. And there\nwe go. Everything's now stacking.\n\nAnd while that's working,\nit's kind of awkward, right?\n\nBecause nothing's taking up enough\nspace. We have all this room,\n\nbut we're not using it right now.\nSo then you go, Oh, okay, well,\n\nwe can fix that as well. So now we\ncan come back and let's take a look,\n\nwhat we had my hero text, which had\na width on it and my hero image,\n\nbut we also gave, uh, so they're\nthe hero image. So both of those,\n\nwe gave a width too. So\nthat means now I want,\n\nwant to come down and\nsay that my hero text,\n\nand we might as well do\ncomma dot hero, uh, image,\n\nbecause we want both of them and\nwe can do is 100% and there we\n\ngo. Okay.\n\nSo now we actually have a bit of a\nmobile layout coming for that section\n\nthere and well, that's cool.\nAnd know it's a good start.\n\nAnd then I guess we could come\ndown and say that my dot hero image\n\nalso has emerging top of,\nI dunno to M something,\n\njust to give it a little bit of space\nthere and it's starting to come together,\n\nactually that's not too bad. And\nthen as the screen gets bigger,\n\nit's working and then suddenly we break\ninto two columns. Well, that's awesome.\n\nCool. So let's shrink that back down\nand let's go look down here now.\n\nAnd Oh my goodness. Look at\nthat. That's working too. Ooh,\n\nthat's kinda ugly though,\nhow this is working out.\n\nSo we also want to come here and say that\nmy well let's go and check their names\n\nout. That was my primary\ncontent and my sidebar.\n\nSo we can come there and select those two.\n\nSo primary content and sidebar.\n\nAnd now they're both be back at a\nhundred percent and look at that. Isn't,\n\nit's coming together now.\n\nSo this is what it's going to\nlook like at small screens.\n\nAnd then we get to the big screens.\n\nAll of a sudden it jumps\nover to two columns,\n\nand then we go back\ndown that way and boom,\n\nit falls into one card and\nI have a responsive website.\n\nThat's really cool. Uh, we\nhaven't done the navigation yet.\n\nWe're gonna be saving that for later,\n\njust cause it's a little bit more\ncomplicated to pull this off,\n\nbut you can see it's sort of, you know,\nat least our, because our row thing,\n\nwe do have a little bit\nof a break there, I guess,\n\nbut the whole thing up here does not\nlook very good, but for the rest of it,\n\nit's coming together.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/269778-day-15-intro-to-media-queries/779604-adding-one-to-our-layout?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1623">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/nla0zdashu","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT6M28S","name":"03-02 - breakpoints.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/7ae574419e95fd423bb69518bc6a7769c3bfbdf1.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/5b012e04fa24143580a6f5297940f2987cfd6f9b.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/nla0zdashu","uploadDate":"2020-04-27","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So in this video,\n\nwe're going to be discussing\nbreak points and break points are,\n\nwhat is the width that things\nchange? When do we do it?\n\nYou will see a lot of people\nwho use very standard numbers.\n\nThey find something from say, bootstrap,\n\nor they look at what\nspecific device sizes are.\n\nSo maybe you come in here and you\ngo, okay. An iPad is seven 68 wide.\n\nSo you seven 68 and an iPhone\nsix let's say is three 75.\n\nSo you decide to use three 75 and we\ndon't have anything else know you could\n\nbring in laptops, sizes and other stuff.\n\nAnd I get this question a lot of what\nsize should I use for my break points?\n\nI know some people who literally try\nand target as many devices as they can.\n\nAnd for me, that bothers\nme a little bit. Um, no,\n\nwell break point doesn't mean this break\npoint is like it's changing at that\n\npoint is sort of how you\ncan see a break point. Um,\n\nI've turned it off on purpose here.\nSo when I'm getting to my small sizes,\n\nwe can see that things are breaking.\n\nSo even though it's not really\nwhat the name is implying,\n\nthe way I like to see break points is\nwhen does my layout start to fail at one\n\npoint, does it just not work\nanymore? And do I need to fix it?\n\nAnd how do I figure that out?\n\nI figure it out by looking at my\nlayout and playing with my layout.\n\nSo in a case like this, it's\nworking, it's working, it's working.\n\nAnd then at one point, I'm going to decide\nthis image is getting too small. No,\n\nyesterday I was doing it 600. I was\nusing 600 pixels. My break point here.\n\nI think that 600 actually\nworks kind of, well,\n\nmaybe the image is getting kind of tiny.\n\nMaybe we could have gone\nwith something a bit bigger.\n\nAnd part of this does mean you have to\nhave some sort of design ideas in mind\n\nfor that, and you could sort of\ndecide and you're looking here. Um,\n\nbut the one problem is this area\ncan still look okay. And down here,\n\nit doesn't look good.\n\nLike when this was at 600 pixels\nor so we're getting to here,\n\nlike this sidebar does not look very nice.\n\nSo the one thing is I'm looking for\nwhen my layout is starting to break.\n\nBut the other thing that I'm looking\nfor is I'm also looking to not have one\n\nbreak point at like six 25 here and\nthen six 75 here or something like that.\n\nYou can technically have as\nmany break points as you want,\n\nbut just to make your\nCSS easier to maintain,\n\nI'm really going to suggest you\ntry and keep them to a minimum.\n\nYou're definitely,\n\nor you're probably going to want to have\nmore than one simple designs though.\n\nSometimes you can easily\nget away with one,\n\nor if you're using things like max width,\n\nwe're going to see this layer works\nreally well with one media query.\n\nThere are times when you're going\nto want to get more complicated.\n\nYou're looking at very\nspecific situations.\n\nYou might want to fix things here or\nthere that are a little bit different,\n\nbut in this case,\n\nI'm going to be approaching this\nat looking at this area here,\n\nbecause it's not going to\nlook too bad up here either.\n\nAnd I honestly think that when\nI'm getting to around here,\n\nthis is when it's starting to get too\nnarrow and that's right around 900 pixels.\n\nSo we can come in here and\nsay 900 pixels and hit save.\n\nAnd now it's working good\nhere. I want to get to that.\n\nIt's going to jump over to this\nview and you might be going, Ooh,\n\nthat image is way too big now. Or\nmaybe you come down and you go,\n\nthat sidebar is way too big now.\nHmm. So then you go, okay. Um,\n\nI don't really like it there let's\ntry 800 and now we can try it\n\nagain and say, okay, that's looking\npretty good there. And you know what?\n\nThat's looking a little bit better.\nThis image is a little bit big.\n\nThis is a bit big here. Um, but the\nother thing to be aware of is, you know,\n\nwhat devices have a screen size of 791\npixels. It's probably not too many.\n\nUh, I'm going to put a link down at the\nbottom of this that does link to common\n\ndevice sizes. They're sort of\ncommon thresholds that do exist,\n\nbut you don't want to\ntarget specific devices.\n\nCause there's just too many\ndevices to possibly ever target.\n\nAnd it's good to know the general\ntimes where things should look good,\n\nbut don't kill yourself in\nhaving 10 different breakpoints.\n\nIf you can do the same thing with\none or the same thing with two.\n\nNow this idea we're going to explore more\nas we get into the other layer that I\n\nhave supplied.\n\nAnd I'm going to build that one up from\nscratch and sort of explore it a little\n\nbit.\n\nBut I do just want you thinking about\nwhen you are bringing in media queries,\n\ndo not overthink it, find a break point,\n\nfind two break points where you need to\nmake changes because the layout isn't\n\nworking. If it's not supplied\nto you by the designer,\n\nthen it wasn't supplied\nto you by the designer.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you can't at least\nput in a rough estimate of what works\n\ngood for you based on what\nyou're looking at on the screen.\n\nAnd as long as things are generally\ngrouped within a single break point or two\n\nbreak points or even three break points,\n\nif you need to make adjustments\nto that break point,\n\nit's not that big of a deal. If you\nhave a lot of styles wrapped inside one,\n\nthen that's going to work out really well.\n\nIt's going to actually be pretty good if\nyou do need to adjust that break point.\n\nWhereas if you're using five,\nsix, seven or more breakpoints,\n\nif you need to start making adjustments\nand you're adjusting this one,\n\nwhich then needs to meet\nthat one and then, well,\n\nthere's a problem with that other one,\n\nit just becomes so much\nharder to maintain.\n\nSo it's not about each section of the\nsite being perfect because nobody goes\n\nlike this, except for you and me.\n\nIf you're a developer you're going like\nthis and you're restricting and making\n\nthings bigger and looking\nat how everything looks and\nif you're a regular user,\n\nyou're opening up the site and that's\nyour site when you're generally not\n\nchanging the size of it to explore what\nit might look like at different screen\n\nsizes. Yeah. The more you have, the\nharder things are going to be to maintain.\n\nSo try and get a general idea of where\nthings are on your site that are breaking\n\nand try and build, break\npoints around those. Uh,\n\nyou'll also find that in general,\n\nyou're going to start using the same\nrough numbers a lot of the time. Um,\n\nI tend to find things\nbreak around 600 pixels,\n\nwhich was why I took that as a start.\nIt might be six, it might be six 60.\n\nIt might even be 700, depending\non your layout, your font sizes,\n\nyour maximum width.\n\nSo many different things can have a\nplay in where things are working and not\n\nworking. So you can start\nwith that. Uh, but again,\n\naround 600 and 900 or 700 and\n900, you know, might be 709 60.\n\nI end up using nine 60 a lot.\n\nMaybe it's because I was designing\nstuff back with the nine 60 grid before.\n\nBut I do find that's a nice time to\nget into your full blow in big layout,\n\nbut you know, there's, you\ndon't need to get pixel perfect.\n\nAnd you definitely shouldn't be targeting\nvery specific devices, but again,\n\nyou should be trying to use the minimum\namount of break points that you need to\n\nbe able to have a nice looking and\nfunctional layout. The more you have,\n\nthe harder everything is to maintain.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/271451-day-16-what-breakpoints-to-use/784563-how-do-decide-what-breakpoints-to-use?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1676">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/38fia64etd","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT4M18S","name":"03-04-meta-viewport.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/8aa521f10636022aba7f9ad81828c27b5a87dc18.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/538cad5d2d8611fe8c96014083ebc97eb671ec55.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/38fia64etd","uploadDate":"2020-04-28","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"Today's lesson is going\nto be a really short one,\n\nbut it's because tomorrow we're\ngoing into something quite a bit big.\n\nI'm going to go into the\nsolution of that challenge.\n\nI'd given you a few days\nago. And in that video,\n\nI'm going to be exploring a lot of\ndifferent concepts and a lot of different\n\nthings. So it will be a\nbit of a longer video.\n\nAnd then we still have to\nmake our navigation responsive\nand we still have a few\n\ndifferent things to do. And we're getting\nso close to the end. We're Wednesday,\n\nwe're going to be done by the\nend of this week. So, um, yeah,\n\nthis video is going to be short,\n\nbut what I want to talk\nabout is this guy right here,\n\nand actually let's make my browser or\nnot. My editor here a little bit bigger.\n\nAnd it's this line right here. Now,\nwhenever I'm writing a website,\n\nit automatically it's thrown in there.\n\nSo I always forget to mention\nit to people. And, um,\n\nI'm going to explore tomorrow\nhow I automatically get it there,\n\nbut it's a really important line of code.\n\nAnd it's something that we haven't really\nrun into yet because we weren't using\n\nmedia queries until very recently, we\njust started looking at them this week.\n\nUm,\n\nbut what this guy does is it ensures\nthat your website's actually going to be\n\nresponsive to the way you\nwant it to be. So it's a,\n\nmeta-tags looking at your\nviewport and what it's doing,\n\nis it saying that the width\nis the device width? So, um,\n\nso the view ports width is the width of\nyour device is pretty much what this is\n\nsaying. And the initial scale\nis one. So we're not zoomed in,\n\nwe're not zoomed out.\n\nWe're setting everything up with this to\nmake sure that it doesn't do something\n\na little bit strange, because\nif you think back to the,\n\nreally the original days of\nthe web, uh, or not of the web,\n\nbut when cell phones\nfirst started coming out,\n\nwe weren't necessarily designing websites\nfor phones. So a lot of the time,\n\nall it was was you took your\nwebsite and you crammed it in there.\n\nAll of the mobile browsers we have,\nif you end up on a nonresponsive site,\n\nthey're going to make sure the whole\nthing shows up there with that weird\n\noverflows and other\nstuff going on this guy,\n\nif you don't have it on,\nlet's see what would happen.\n\nSo I'm going to comment that out and\nwe're gonna come over to Chrome because\n\nChrome is responsive mode simulates this.\n\nWhereas my experience is Firefox\nis doesn't. So in this one,\n\nI am going to be using Chrome.\n\nChrome does try to simulate the\nuser experience of a mobile device a\n\nlittle bit more. It's a click,\nlike a push up and push down. Uh,\n\nit doesn't have the pointer.\nYou don't have hovers.\n\nSo they do try and simulate it a\nbit. And this is where we left off.\n\nExcept I fixed that little\nmistake. I'd left navigation. Um,\n\nbut you'll see when I go\nup, everything looks fine.\n\nBut when I start getting\nsmaller, at one point,\n\nwhen we get to that 1100 pixel\nbrake light lock-in point,\n\nit locks there and it just starts\nshrinking my whole site down and getting\n\nsmaller and smaller and smaller.\nAnd that's not what, you know, we,\n\nwe just spent a bunch of\ntime making media queries.\n\nWe want to make sure that they work.\n\nNot that our whole website\njust shrinks down like this.\n\nSo that's without this on. As soon\nas I do turn it on and hit save,\n\nand I come back, now, you can see\nit works just as we expected it to.\n\nSo now my media queries are kicking\nin and then getting my columns,\n\ngoing back and forth when\nI want them just like that.\n\nSo this is one of those things that\npeople bang their head against.\n\nCause they forget to put that in there\nor they never even heard that they needed\n\nthat to be in there. So I don't\nwant you to run into this problem.\n\nIf you're doing a course like this,\n\nthat's focusing on responsive layouts\nand how to be able to conquer them.\n\nAnd then you finish this course,\n\nyou walk out and you make\nsomething that should be perfect.\n\nAnd it just zooms out when you're on a\nmobile and you start going crazy. Um,\n\nespecially if you use my advice and\nstart developing on Firefox a lot,\n\nyou might not even notice this when\nyou're opening up your responsive mode.\n\nSo it's a nice, simple one, but we're\ngoing to look in, as I said tomorrow,\n\nwhen we tackle the challenge, we'll see\nhow you will never forget this anyway,\n\nbut I really want you to\nknow what this is here for.\n\nMake sure you never delete\nit. If you have it on a site.\n\nAnd if ever you run into\nthat problem of your site,\n\nzooming out when you're on mobile.\nOh yes. I know. There's something.\n\nI don't remember exactly how to write it,\n\nbut I do know there's some sort\nof metatags or header, you know,\n\nit doesn't even have to\nremember that it's a meta, uh,\n\njust something in my head that I need\nand then you'll Google it and it will pop\n\nup right away. So just knowing that\nyou're missing something that you need,\n\nthat's all you need. You\ndon't have to memorize this.\n\nJust know that there's something that\ngoes in the head that fixes that problem\n\nin case it ever pops up.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/272982-day-17-the-viewport-meta-tag/788634-the-meta-viewport-tag?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1729">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/mt4q98mhwh","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT10M50S","name":"challenge-00.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/c8eed40da06e49d1219648053ae8964128a7b639.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/ce6e98917a14fc509e5526a165c3255674f6598b.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/mt4q98mhwh","uploadDate":"2020-04-30","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"All right. So it is time to look at\nhow we can make this layout right here,\n\nlooking just like this. So in this video,\n\nI'm just going to be\nwriting the HTML for it. Um,\n\nI did realize one little\nmistake I made, I made,\n\nwhen I shared this at the black box here,\n\nwasn't meant to be something that you\nactually had to wrap your whole design in.\n\nUm, so I think what\nsome people interpreted,\n\nand this is completely my fault of the\nmaximum width of a container being 1128.\n\nthat was for sort of like cutting and\nholding all the content here and not so\n\nmuch the background. So if you did\nit a little bit differently than me,\n\nI do apologize for that.\n\nI should've made it a bit more clear\nthat this was the browser window, um,\n\nor the total size and not sort\nof how we want to exactly later.\n\nSo if you did that, that is fine.\nUh, it's not the end of the world,\n\nas long as you got it working, that is\nthe most important thing. So for this,\n\nI'm going to leave the design appear\non the screen while I start writing my\n\nHTML, because I just find it easier.\n\nOne thing I am going to be doing with\nthis is even though we only have a desktop\n\ndesign, cause when I gave this to you,\n\nwe haven't even talked about media\nqueries or doing small screen layouts.\n\nI'm still going to code this\nwhole thing up mobile first,\n\nbut whenever I'm quoting any design,\n\nI'm always going to look at the large\nscreen layout for writing the HTML,\n\nbecause the structure of my HTML,\n\nit's really important that I can control\nit in a way that when we get to the\n\nbigger screens, I can organize\nthings the way I need it to.\n\nSo if you started everything\nat the small screen,\n\nthen you'd be going back\nand forth all the time.\n\nSo I'm already in my HTML\nlooking at the large screen,\n\nbut when I start writing the CSS,\nI'm going to start mobile first.\n\nWe're going to see that more in the next\nvideo and what I mean by that and why I\n\nprefer it overdoing desktop first.\n\nSo the very first thing\nhere is my index file.\n\nAnd I'm just going to do an escalation\npoint like that and push tab.\n\nSo this is that whole Emmett\nthing that I told you about,\n\nand you can see it outputs\nall of this, just like that.\n\nYou might see other people who do the\nsame by writing HTML five and hitting tab.\n\nAnd that does the exact same\nthing. I like saving keystrokes.\n\nSo just a explanation point tab. It\nshould give you exactly what you need.\n\nAnd, uh, while we're here, actually,\n\nI'm going to space things out a little\nbit more just cause when we're reading\n\nHTML, we tend, you know,\n\nthis can get a little bit longer and CSS\ntends to be a little bit smaller. Um,\n\nso we sort of have these different\nsections that go all the way down on this.\n\nUh, I'm calling each one of these, a\nsection and not a header or footer,\n\ncause I don't really have a header\nor footer on, in this layout.\n\nSo I'm just gonna stick with\nsection for each one of them.\n\nSo we can just do section and there's\nfaster ways of doing this, but um,\n\nif you are using vs code, there is\nthis really cool thing. Where is,\n\nif you have something that you want to\nrepeat, you can do a shift alt and down,\n\nand I don't know the shortcut\non a Mac. I do apologize.\n\nAnd it's going to just copy that\nor downward. So there we go.\n\nWe have my four sections for my site.\nNow, each one of these does need a class.\n\nSo I'm going to do a class is\nequal to, and we'll do an intro.\n\nI'm not going to be very creative\nwith my class names here,\n\nsince it's all just generic content.\nI'm just going to do a section two,\n\nsection three and section four.\nWe'll speed that up. Alright.\n\nAnd now we want to come in. I like\nspacing them out a little bit,\n\njust cause it makes it easier\nfor me to stay organized.\n\nAnd my intro doesn't have\nvery much. Um, now one thing,\n\nthis is sort of just a paragraph. Um,\n\nso I'm going to do that as a\nparagraph and then in each one.\n\nSo we can just do a P with\nthe class of intro text,\n\nI guess that's fine. It's not,\n\nmaybe not the best just cause\nit's going to be before that,\n\nbut whatever I'm going to do\nthat. And then each one, um,\n\nnow this is where BIM\ncan get messy, messy, uh,\n\nwhere we could have like an\nintro, uh, title. Let's say, um,\n\nthis could be main title.\n\nIf it's something that's on every single\npage and it's not always an a class\n\nintro, maybe your main title is somewhere\nelse on a different page. You could,\n\nyou could definitely just\ncall this title like that.\n\nI'm going to leave it\nas intro title, discuss.\n\nI don't have any other content to work\naround and it's going to make it a little\n\nbit more obvious when I'm writing my CSS,\n\nbut it really depends on the cases\nfor you, such as these ones here,\n\nbecause they're all exactly the same,\nexcept the color changes a little bit. Um,\n\nI'm probably gonna give those the same\nclass despite the fact that they end up\n\nin each section and so well,\nthat's all we need for that one.\n\nSo then my section two is going to be,\n\nwe're going to have a\ncouple of different things.\n\nSo the first thing we'll do an H\ntwo, I'm going to call it a section,\n\na section title, uh, not like\nthat, like this section title.\n\nSo it's not my section to title cause\nI want the same styles for that one and\n\nthat one. So I'm just going\nto do a section title and uh,\n\nI'm not putting the text in now cause\nit's boring to watch me copy and paste.\n\nI'll come through and do that\nin between the two segments.\n\nI just want to worry about the\nstructure that I'm building now. Um,\n\nnow I'm doing this as one big thing\nbecause you can see that it's centered\n\nacross the two columns. So what's\nactually happening here. Uh,\n\num,\n\nso right here we can see like this is\none big box went all the way across the\n\ntop like that. And then I have my\ntwo columns coming underneath it.\n\nSo what I need to do is\nI need to make one box.\n\nThat's going to hold both of those.\n\nAnd then we have a paragraph in there\nand then we'll have our paragraph there.\n\nSo that ends up getting split into\ntwo different columns like that. Um,\n\nyou might get times where it's more\nlike this and actually we'll get there,\n\nbut just here we have one big\nbox that has my two columns.\n\nSo here we have a column there and then\nwe have a column coming up on that side.\n\nSo the organization of it is going\nto be a little bit different.\n\nLet's get rid of all those.\n\nCause it's a little hard to see my\nlines are not very straight. Um,\n\nthen I guess, I mean this, I said,\n\nwe're gonna have a\ncontainer in here actually.\n\nSo like this all should be probably\ncontained in one big box. Um, I,\n\nwe didn't put one here. I guess we could,\n\nbut it's not the end of\nthe world without it. Um,\n\njust because I'm going to have\na line break there anyway.\n\nSo I think we can get away without it.\n\nBut if you did a container or you\nknow what, let's just be consistent.\n\nWe'll put a container in\neach one of these container\n\nand then so here too,\nwe'd want dot container.\n\nAnd in this case,\n\nmy container can't be a row because I\ndon't want this to be a flux child or a\n\nflex item. I want these two only to be.\n\nSo I have my title at the top and\nthen underneath that we can do a row\n\nand then inside each row I can have\ntwo columns. So I am using them here.\n\nSo I'm going to do dot\ncol times two and hit tab.\n\nAnd each one of those gets\nit column in it or sorry,\n\neach it creates two\ncolumns, I should say. Uh,\n\nso P and then I can come down\nhere and P and so there's my\n\ntwo paragraphs. Technically I\ndon't really need the column.\n\nI can just have it as each\nparagraph is becoming a flex item.\n\nIf you did it that way, that's perfectly\nfine too. It would definitely work. Um,\n\nthe only reason I like doing it with\nthe actual column is I'm always thinking\n\nwhat if the text got changed later?\nIf somebody came and said, well,\n\nthis should actually be two paragraphs.\nSo we're going to put two in each.\n\nThen you don't have to go through\nand change any of the markup.\n\nYou just have to come and paste a couple\nof new paragraphs in which I guess is\n\nchanging your reach to Mount.\nBut you know what I mean?\n\nYou're not changing the structure.\n\nYou're just adding content\nand that is it for here.\n\nSo now we can come down to\nthis one. So here, as I said,\n\nthis one's a little bit different\ncause we have a container,\n\nbut I can also do that container road\ntrick where this becomes a row and this\n\nyear is going to be a row or sorry,\n\nwe have the row and a container\nwith our two columns inside of it.\n\nSo here's my section three.\nSo container, container,\n\nrow, just like that. And\nthen inside of there,\n\nuh, we need to have a column times two,\n\nthe first column will have my\nage to have a section title,\n\num, as well as a paragraph\nso I can do plus P.\n\nAnd so I have my section\ntitle, which right there,\n\nand then I have this one here. Um,\n\nI think what I'm also going to\ndo for my section title, um,\n\nbecause we have different colors on\nthem, I think on this section title,\n\njust cause we only have it once and sorry\nfor all the scribbles I'm doing. Uh,\n\nbut for this section title over here,\n\nwhat I'm going to do is actually give\nthis a modifier because these two are the\n\nsame. Um, and so my section title,\nand then that's my section two.\n\nI think what I'll do is section\ntitle, hyphen hyphen, light,\n\ndark, dark, um, I could call it like a\nlight background, but it's a dark title.\n\nWhereas the default for it's\ngoing to be a light color.\n\nAnd if you wanted to have a dark on\nthat and a light on this one, um,\n\nyou could definitely\ndo something like that,\n\nbut I'm just going to simplify it for now.\n\nIf you're building out\na bigger design system,\n\nyou'd probably have something with a dark\nand a light just to make it easier for\n\npeople to apply the color that they\nwant, or it might be, you know,\n\nyou might even have, uh, six different\ncolors that your section titles could be.\n\nSo you'd have different\nmodifiers to change the color,\n\nthe different colors you could use. Um,\n\nso section that's my section title dark,\n\nthen here we have my regular section\ntitle with a paragraph and then over in\n\nthis, we'll go and throw\nin another image. Um,\n\nI don't think we need a\nclass on there or anything.\n\nSo I'm just going to put in my image,\n\nwhich is in my image folder\nand my nicely named images.\n\nUh, so here we can just put, um,\n\na sun set over a mountain range\n\ncoming down to section four. It's very\nsimilar to the previous one we did.\n\nSo we're going to do our\ncontainer container row.\n\nAnd if you did like a div class container\nand then inside that a div class row,\n\njust like we looked at last\nweek, that's completely fine.\n\nThe way you organize it,\n\nas long as it makes sense and\npeople could follow it is great.\n\nAnd if you didn't use\ncontainer row in column,\n\nyou use different naming conventions.\nThat is also perfectly fine.\n\nThere's no issues with it whatsoever.\nSo here in this one, in this case,\n\nwe need column times\ntwo. so.call times two.\n\nAnd then in the first one this time we\nonly have our image inside the first\n\nimage. Well, let's just do\nit. Image image zero two,\n\nthe two of them are really\nsimilar. So maybe we'll say a,\n\na sunset over a mountain range,\n\noops range with tree branches\n\nin the foreground. There you go. Um,\n\nand then we come down\nto our second column.\n\nSo now we're looking at\nthis right here. Once again,\n\nwe have our H two section\ntitle plus a paragraph.\n\nAnd just like that, the\nHTML is completely done.\n\nIf you did not do the challenge and\nyou'd want to take it from here,\n\nI'm going to upload this after this\nlesson. So you can just take the HTML.\n\nAll the text will actually be in place\nand you can take that and, you know,\n\ngo from there. If you want,\ninstead of starting from scratch,\n\nit's completely up to you\nif you want to use it.\n\nBut if you want to give\nit a shot, you can.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/274380-day-18-challenge-solution-mobile-first/793027-flexbox-challenge-4-solution-writing-the-html?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1782">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/4uh4jkhxsc","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT16M30S","name":"challenge-000.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/39ca892f7bfac0ff93520a68fd270b53c20be1d7.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/7f3e204aae91b14b4cde2f37b8d6d962b9bd1706.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/4uh4jkhxsc","uploadDate":"2020-04-30","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"Okay. So now we are at the fun part of\nmaking this into a fully functioning and\n\nnice looking website.\n\nAnd I said that I would mention\nwhy I like doing mobile first,\n\nfirst and up until now.\nWe've only been doing, um,\n\nup until now. The one\nthing we did look at,\n\nwe were doing desktop first and\nI didn't talk too much about it.\n\nWe just we'd created a desktop\nwebsite and it looked okay.\n\nSo we just kept going. Now,\n\nthe reason we did a desktop website first\nwas because we started with a desktop\n\ndesign. We made it, it looked good.\n\nAnd then I introduced me to queries and\nlooked at how we could get it to work.\n\nAnd this is a very common way\npeople do work, but personally,\n\nI don't think it's the best way to work.\n\nEven though we started\nwith a desktop design.\n\nNow we did look at the desktop\nwebsite when I was creating this.\n\nI was or not the desktop\nwebsite, but the desktop design,\n\nbecause I needed to structure\nthis properly to be able\nto work at large screen\n\nsizes. But for small screen\nsizes, if we take a look here\n\nand I opened up my responsive mode\nand just a heads up a shift control\n\nM or if you're on a Mac,\n\nI think it's shift option M\nbut I might be a shift command.\n\nM I'm not sure you'd have to travel\nto the moat. And thank you for,\n\nI don't know, remember who it was,\n\nbut someone in the discord had\nmentioned to me that you can do that.\n\nSo this is only in Firefox. Um,\nif the dev tools are not opened,\n\nyou can do the same thing in Chrome,\nbut only if your dev tools are open to,\n\nso you can just toggle that on and off.\n\nAnd so we can play with the screen\nsize. And other than my images,\n\nwe already have a responsive website.\nRemember that from like day one, I think,\n\num, you know, we're week one. Anyway,\n\nwhen we saw that we have a responsive\nwebsite before we write any CSS,\n\nit's us who take that\nresponsiveness away from it.\n\nSo we don't want to do that in this case.\n\nSo whenever I start reading my\nCSS or before I even do that,\n\nwe should actually link to our CSS\nfile. That would be a good idea. Um,\n\nI think I just called it style that\nCSS, and let's go over to that file,\n\nwhich is completely blank right now.\nAnd the way I do it to always, uh, well,\n\nthe first thing we, I always start\nwith this, my box sizing before and my,\n\nuh,\n\nafter box sizing boarder box.\n\nThe next thing I generally do, uh,\n\nlet's come down and I worry\nabout these things over here.\n\nThe fonts essentially are the most\nimportant thing that we're going to be\n\nlooking at. So we do need to\nlink to the Google fonts, uh,\n\nthat actually I'm gonna put in my HTML\nas well. We'll bring that right here.\n\nI've already copied the code for\nit. So you can paste that in.\n\nSo we're linking to the Google font there,\n\nand then we actually want to use the\ndifferent fonts that are available to us.\n\nSo I have them here, I have the rubato\nand that one I'm going to support. Now,\n\nwe're going to copy this and leave\nit as a comment here at the top.\n\nSo I can easily access\nthese when I find family,\n\nwhen I need these, if you know me, I\nnormally put these as a CSS variable,\n\nbut I don't want to get into, um,\nor I should say CSS custom property.\n\nDon't want to get into those, but, um,\n\nI'll leave a link to the bottom if you're\ncurious about them and you don't know\n\nabout them yet because they are amazing.\n\nSo at the very first thing I'm\ngonna do is go in my body and say,\n\nmargin is zero.\n\nWe'll give it a font family of\nI'm going to use rubato just\n\nbecause it is the one that's\nused the most it's used in, well,\n\nit's used in my paragraphs,\nbut it's, you know,\n\nit's also used in this guy up here. Um,\n\nso we can just grab that\nand put it there in general.\n\nBody is body copy.\n\nIt's the things that are going to be\nused for paragraphs essentially. Um,\n\nso most of the things that I'm\nputting on here will be for that.\n\nSo the font size will be\nnumber four 21 pixels.\n\nSo font size, uh,\n\nif you do the math on that\nthree, a 1.3, one, two, five REM,\n\nand the, I didn't give a line height,\n\nI'm going to go with a line height\nof 1.6, or I tend to start at 1.6,\n\neven though it's a little bit big,\n\nI prefer having too much spacing and then\nslowly reducing it than the other way\n\naround. So I'm going to go with that.\nWe'll see what it looks like, uh,\n\nin a minute, um, my color on it,\nI'm gonna, I didn't list a color,\n\nbut I mean, he gets, it was\nthat guy right there. Uh,\n\nso here we can also give\nthis color, uh, right there.\n\nAnd I guess we can hit save at this\npoint and make sure things are actually\n\nworking and updating. And we can\nsee that they definitely are.\n\nSo we're off and running pretty\nmuch, right. We're off and running,\n\nturn off mobile mode for now.\nAnd as I said before, we do we,\n\nthis is actually, I'm turning\nit off. But once again,\n\nwe have a responsive layout.\nEverything here is responsive. Just,\n\nI want to reiterate that a lot\nas I, as I go through this, um,\n\nanother thing that we need to do,\n\nand we looked at once is images and they\nare the one thing that by default isn't\n\nresponsive, they will overflow\nthe side. So on these,\n\nwe will give them a max width of 100%.\n\nThe reason I like doing a max width of a\nhundred percent and not just a width of\n\n100% is because that means they will\nshrink if there's not enough room,\n\nbut it won't stretch them. If not,\n\ncause if we just set a regular width\nof 100% on them, if it's a small image,\n\nlike these ones are when\nthey get to big sizes,\n\nthey're going to get pixelated and they're\nnot going to look super great. Like,\n\nlook how ugly the street looks right now.\n\nI know it's a blurry tree to begin with,\nbut you know, when it's at small sizes,\n\nit looks fine. A lot of\nthese things will be okay,\n\nbut once we blow them up and we stretch,\nyou start seeing pixels and everything,\n\nit does not look super great.\n\nSo that's why I sit with a max\nwidth of a hundred percent.\n\nSo they will never be bigger than the\noriginally were meant to be for background\n\nimages. I worry less about it cause\nthey shouldn't be as much of a focus.\n\nIt's probably a decorate.\n\nIt's probably an image with text on\ntop of the text should be King anyway.\n\nAnd so there's my images there. Okay. Um,\n\nand normally let's actually,\nlet's do a bit of our topography.\n\nSo I had my I'm actually into\nH one H two. We don't have one,\n\nbut a lot of the time on these I'm\nactually going through and giving them a\n\nmargin of zero. I'm not sure we\nwant to do that because of this.\n\nSo I'm not going to bother this time,\n\nbut it is very common that I removed my\nmargins from my headings or at least the\n\nmargin tops. So maybe we'll do that.\nThis time margin top will be zero.\n\nUm, just because, you know,\n\nwe're creating extra space\non top of stuff for nothing.\n\nMost of the time it's going\nto create alignment issues.\n\nThe margin tops generally on\ntype tend to get in the way,\n\nbut they are always there. So it\nis good to know about that. Uh,\n\none other thing we can do here is our\nfont family that we have cause we have\n\nthat font family. So there we go.\n\nThe fonts are already looking a lot better\njust by making that one change right\n\nthere. Uh, except the font weight\ndoesn't look bold enough and it might be,\n\ncause I actually have\nthat one on my computer.\n\nSo I am going to specify the font\nweight of 900 specifically on that.\n\nActually I didn't say my index\nfile. I'm looking at going,\n\nthat's not the right font. That's it\nsaved there? How that looks a lot better.\n\nThere we go. So I didn't save\nwhen I added my Google font link.\n\nSo the fonts weren't\nactually coming in properly.\n\nSo that looks a little\nbit nicer, doesn't it?\n\nAnd they think that's all we\nneed for those. So that's good.\n\nAnd you see here,\n\nit's like mostly generic stuff and I\nalways start with my typography first and\n\nnow I think we can get, start\ngetting a little bit more specific,\n\nbut I'm not going to\nworry about my layouts.\n\nAnd I know my columns and my container\nI container will bring in in a minute,\n\nbut I'm not, I'm not doing\nanything layout related. Uh,\n\nI just want to focus on the very basics,\n\nwhich are things like the\nintro has a background of,\n\nand this is too small for me to read.\n\nUh, so we'll hit save. There we go. Uh,\n\nwe'll add a bunch of padding to that and\nwe're going to look at the cool trick\n\nfor this as well. But for now,\nuh, I did give a, a challenge,\n\nextra little challenge\ndown here for this area,\n\nbut for now I'm just going to\ngive it padding of, I don't know,\n\nwe'll just go 400 pixels top\nand bottom zero left. And right,\n\nmaybe that was a bit big.\nWe'll stick with that.\n\nWe'll do a text align center.\nAnd I think even here,\n\nI'm just going to do my color\nof the dark color that I have\n\nbecause then what I can do\non here is my intro text.\n\nUh, cause we have a few\nthings on this. We want to do,\n\nwe want to do text transform upper case,\n\nupper case.\n\nI think the font size on this one was\nactually smaller that one's at 18 pixels.\n\nSo 18 is a font size\nof 1.1, two, five REM.\n\nAnd we also want to do a letter\n\nspacing of many with like three pixels.\n\nUsually this number is gonna be really\nsmall. It's probably not even enough yet.\n\nUh, that looks a little bit better\nso that it's not too bad, actually.\n\nI'm pretty with that.\nThe color is off though.\n\nSo let's bring this back up\nfor a second, grab the color.\n\nAnd I will also put a margin of zero\non that just to see, there we go.\n\nIt's sucked in a little bit closer,\n\nso that is working out nicely and I'm\ngonna break this a little bit of a smaller\n\nscreen size actually, while I work on\nit. And that's also going to permit me a,\n\nwe might as well just keep this here,\n\nright on the side and then I\ncan shrink this down. Okay.\n\nAnd look at both at the\nsame time. There we go. Ah,\n\nactually here where I\nhave my H one and H two,\n\njust cause I see there's a really big\nspace between these let's just come on\n\nhere and give this a line height\nof one. Start with maybe a,\n\nI made it really close here actually. Um,\n\nit's a little bit dangerous\nthat they're this close,\n\njust because the H and the P here,\nlike there's no space between them. Um,\n\nbut I think I'll leave it. You know, if\nthe H and P were closer to each other,\n\nthey could touch and overlap each\nother, which would be really ugly. Um,\n\nwhich I guess could happen\nif I resize the screen a bit,\n\ndoesn't seem to be happening right now.\nBut anyway, just something like there,\n\nthe be in the wire, pretty\nmuch touching each other.\n\nIt's a little bit dangerous, but you\nknow, maybe we'll bump it up then.\n\nAnd won't, that's, that's\nlooking pretty good.\n\nMaybe actually want a\nlittle bit of space. Um,\n\nactually I need to increase\nthat font size anyway,\n\nbut here I'm going to\nchange that margin to be a,\n\nI would just use zero, zero, and then\nthe bottom will be like a 0.2, five M.\n\nRemember this M is going to be\nrelative to the font size of this.\n\nSo it's like 0.2, five,\nthe size of my font. Uh,\n\nthen we have my intro title.\nI believe we called it.\n\nUm, that one has a bit more, so\nfont size on here will be 60 pixels,\n\nwhich is pretty big at this screen\nsize. But I think that looks okay. Um,\n\nand this is where if I didn't set that\nsmaller line height, when you get to 60,\n\nlike these lines are massively spaced out.\n\nSo whenever you're doing a big font size,\n\nyou definitely need to bring the line\nHeights in on these things. Alright,\n\nthere we go. The just\nchanging the font size.\n\nI don't think there's anything else we\nneed to change on that. So I'm happy.\n\nLet's keep on going. Now.\nOne thing I am going to do,\n\nthat's a bit more generic just cause\nI'm looking here. We have space here.\n\nWe have space here. We have space.\nUh, so here with my element selectors,\n\nrather than class selectors,\n\nI will just do a section\nand do padding of let's\n\ntry five M zero, and we can\nalways adjust from there.\n\nI am looking at small screen sizes.\nMaybe it should be a little bit smaller.\n\nWe'll go with a four and there we go.\n\nI guess we should bring my\ncontainer into. So here,\n\nthe reason I'm bringing in is cause I\nreally don't want my texts touching the\n\nside. So I'm going to give\nthis the width of 95%,\n\nI think any margin of zero\nauto just to stop stuff.\n\nAnd actually let's make that\na bit bigger than 90, 85.\n\nI just want to keep I'm looking at the\nhere and just making sure my text isn't\n\nglued to the side. Cause nothing\ndrives me more crazy than seeing, um,\n\ndesigns where the, um, they're touching\nthe side. That drives me nuts, nuts,\n\nnuts. Um, so there is my\nsection, my container.\n\nI also had my section title,\n\nso that one has a font size of 36\n\npixels. So that would be 2.25 REM\n\nand the section title, as I said, I'm\ngoing to put this as my main color of it.\n\nSo color is that really light color here.\n\nAnd uh, we're going to\nlose it a little bit.\n\nSo we might as well come in with\nthe dark section title as well.\n\nSo the section title dark is a\n\ncolor of, I think if I do that, I\nget to see all the colors I use.\n\nSo I think it was this one. There\nwe go. And perfection, there we go.\n\nThat is nicely done. Maybe I could\nspace it out a little bit more,\n\nbut I think for now I'll\nleave it just like that.\n\nWe'll come down to my section three now.\n\nSo section three needs a\nbackground color of the really dark\n\ncolor. So there it is. Um,\n\nI'm going to do a color of\nFFF or white. That's good.\n\nTake a look at how it's\nlooking. You know what,\n\nI'm sorry about the borders that showed\nup on these two and you can see there's\n\nno border here and we have one here\nthat was being extorted from fig.\n\nI'm not too sure why they came\nin with borders. To be honest,\n\nI do have to investigate\nthat a little bit more. Um,\n\nbut overall I think that is\npretty much done. Okay, cool.\n\nSo then section four,\n\nwe can do a background color of\n\nthis one, right there, a color of FFF.\n\nAnd let's go take a look.\nWell, you know what? That's,\n\nthat's not so bad. There we go.\nEverything sort of came together on that.\n\nUm, ideally, maybe this image is not\nat the top. It's down at the bottom,\n\nbut overall I do think that, you know,\nit's working, we can shrink it down.\n\nI am getting some side scrolling\nactually that's coming from here.\n\nThis text is too big.\nUm, now I am at two 86.\n\nSo if you're in this responsive mode,\n\ndo be careful not to make\nyour screen too small,\n\nbut generally the smallest\ndevices are 320 pixels.\n\nSo what I'm going to do is we're going\nto build an immediate query there to\n\nchange that font size. So my\nsection title, my section intro,\n\ntext intro title, I put 60 pixels.\nI didn't put REM there. I wasn't,\n\nit was in a bit of a rush. Um,\n\nso why don't we shrink that down? I think\nthat's, what's the stray through REM.\n\nI think that's going to do the\njob at pretty small sizes. Yeah.\n\nI don't think we're going to run\ninto any major issues with that.\n\nSo I think that's actually going to work\nand this is where I'm going to stop for\n\na second and say,\n\nthis is why I like starting mobile\nfirst when I'm writing my code,\n\nbecause without doing any layout stuff,\njust coming in, setting up my colors,\n\nbackground colors and spacing. I'm\nfinished my mobile lab now. Okay.\n\nWe could tweak this or we could bring\nthe image down below or something.\n\nThe designer me never gave you\nany specifications for that.\n\nSo maybe you could leave it like this,\n\nbut they might come back and say\nthat it should be at the bottom.\n\nThere are ways that that could be\nhandled. But overall, I think, you know,\n\nthis is looking it's functional\nwhen we're on a mobile,\n\nuh, layout or mobile design, when\nwe're on a mobile size of screen,\n\nit's working. So in the next video,\n\nwe're going to come through and build\nin our media queries for this. But just,\n\nthis is why I like starting mobile first.\n\nCause you don't have to do anything fancy.\n\nYou don't have to worry about layout\ntoo much. Now there are exceptions.\n\nThere are things that are more\ncomplicated, like in navigation,\n\nwe're going to get there soon enough.\nBut for some, a lot of things,\n\nyou're not worried about layout.\n\nYou're just worried about things being\non the page and having their colors and\n\nhaving their fonts. And that's it. There's\nnothing else you have to worry about.\n\nSo it's super easy to just come through\nand set up all these basic things that\n\ndon't have any layout stuff really\nrelated to them other than some spacing.\n\nAnd then after that,\n\nyou can come in and make it work at your\nlarge screen sizes when you need your\n\ncolumns to come in and some other things\nto come in and you start getting fancy\n\nwith it. But at the small sizes,\nnothing much to worry about.\n\nSo in the next video,\n\nwe'll look at adding some media queries\nand how quickly it's going to go from","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/274380-day-18-challenge-solution-mobile-first/793088-flexbox-challenge-4-solution-writing-mobile-first-css?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1835">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/b4jzuuukrh","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT8M37S","name":"challenge-01.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/d12a297ea8b36a201d9a3f48bd2161af7a084e27.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/2ca4a654c60e672de5f3aaa4b844fa1775003b9c.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/b4jzuuukrh","uploadDate":"2020-04-30","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"All right. So this is done. Now. We want\nit to get to work at big screen sizes,\n\nand I'm actually gonna\nmake this bigger on point.\n\nAnd we're going to stretch this out a lot.\n\nAnd this is one thing I want you to avoid.\n\nI want you to avoid lines of texts that\ngo all the way across the screen like\n\nthis, a lot of developers who\nstart making their own sites,\n\ntheir own personal projects.\n\nThis is the dead giveaway\nthat they're not designers.\n\nDesigners will never let a line\nof text come all the way across.\n\nIt's why we have a design.\n\nOften has two columns or three columns\nor more is because lines of texts went\n\nall the way across. Don't look good.\nSo there's just, um, it's not even,\n\nthey don't look. It actually it's, they\ndon't read well, they get too long.\n\nYour eye has trouble tracking properly\nthat you have to like go all the way\n\nacross and then find where\nthe line started here.\n\nSo it's really hard for people to track.\n\nSo the easiest way to stop things from\ngoing all the way across and just getting\n\nsuper, super long on big screen\nsizes is using our max width.\n\nSo that's where we've placed everything\npretty much inside a container.\n\nSo I said in the design\nthat we want to be max with,\n\nthis was in my specifications, one,\none, two, eight PX and hit save.\n\nAnd now we have, it will still\nwork. We still have a minimum size,\n\nbut then when we get to a maximum, it\nwill never get too long. Now, to me,\n\nthis is still too long of a line,\n\nbut at least it's preventing it from\nbeing like stretching from one side of the\n\nscreen to the other. And I'm not even\nrecording my entire screen right now.\n\nSo this could get a lot bigger than that.\n\nSo at least it does fix a little bit\nof an issue with something like that.\n\nSo max width, you don't\neven need a media query.\n\nIt is a good place to start\nafter that. What can we do?\n\nWell now we want to bring in\nour columns. So if you remember,\n\nI talked about in the break point video\nof deciding when the layout is breaking\n\nand part of it can actually be based on\nthe amount of lines, let the characters,\n\nI should say in a line.\n\nSo I'm not going to stress too much\nabout that right now. Um, at my,\n\nI have a bit of an eye for\nit, cause I'm a designer,\n\nbut just remember you don't\nwant really long lines.\n\nThis is a long line of text\nand try re if you're not sure,\n\ntry reading the texts like reading it,\n\nlike a normal person would read it\nas if you're reading everything,\n\nnot skimming it. Um,\n\nlook at other designs to get an idea\nof maximum column width, but I'm gonna,\n\nyou know, for me,\n\nsomewhere around here is\nprobably in, you know,\n\nyou could push it a little bit, but\nI'm going to be a bit conservative.\n\nI'm going to say somewhere\naround here, cause this is,\n\nyou know, even right here,\nwe can get away with it,\n\nwhich is right around\n600 pixels. So why not?\n\nLet's start with our first\nmedia query at 600 pixels.\n\nSo if you remember how\nit's at media parentheses,\n\ncurly braces, this parenthesis right here,\n\nwe need to put in where it will be last,\n\nthe last few videos we're\nwriting in max widths,\n\nbut that's because we were overwriting\nthings that we'd already done.\n\nAnd we were trying to\nfix it for small screens.\n\nNow we're doing it the other way around.\nWe're adapting what we have at small,\n\nfor bigger screens. So we want\nto say from this size and bigger,\n\nmake this change. So if it's from this\nsize and bigger, we use min width,\n\nremember from a minimum width of\n600 and the bigger we can put in\n\nour media here.\n\nSo the very first thing we can\ndo now is we could say that my\n\ndot row becomes a display of flex.\n\nAnd just by doing that,\nnow we have two columns.\n\nSo now we have like that and then it pop,\n\nit turns into two columns and\nlooking at it. Now these columns,\n\nI find them a little narrow. So this is,\nthere's no fault in this you're going.\n\nIt was looking okay, but you know\nwhat, maybe those are too small.\n\nI'm not sure if I really like\nthat. So easy enough to fix.\n\nLet's push it up to eight and see what\nhappens. Okay. So let's just look,\n\nyou know what? I like that a lot better.\n\nI think I'm going to leave it\nlike that. And just like that,\n\nI think we found the break\npoint that we need for this.\n\nAnd I think one break point is going\nto be enough because we have a nice,\n\nsimple layout. We'll you have some that\nnew need more than one break point. Yes,\n\nof course you will. But again,\n\ntry and limit the amount\nof break points you have.\n\nIf you have five break points, unless\nyou have a very good reason for it,\n\nyou need something for huge screens and\nyou wanna do something fancy for them.\n\nOkay? But the less break points you\nhave, the easier it is to maintain.\n\nAnd if you did not read the article\nthat I linked to in the previous lesson,\n\nplease go and read that for deciding on\nwhat break points you're going to use.\n\nIt does a really nice approach.\n\nAnother thing I'm going to do is we\nwant some spacing on our columns.\n\nSo I am going to come in\nhere and say that my column,\n\nthere's two options you have here.\n\nEither the width is a hundred percent\nor we could give them the flex grow of\n\none. Either one of them would end up\npretty much having the same effect on it,\n\nbut I'm going to just ensure, I\ndon't really know if I need that.\n\nMaybe we'll see. Now actually here,\n\nI think we're going to need it to\nmake sure my images are actually 50%.\n\nSo these, if we look\nat the original design,\n\nthis and this lined up\nwith this one in this one,\n\nso I'm going to go with the same thing\njust to make sure everything is lining up\n\nbecause without that my paragraphs,\n\nwhich are longer squished\nmy pictures away.\n\nSo I'm going to say that my columns\nshould have a width of 100%,\n\nwhich helps balance\nthings out a little bit.\n\nAnd we can also come in and say that\n\na.call plus a.call as a\n\nmargin, is it right or left?\n\nIt's going to be a margin\nleft of it's pretty big.\n\nI'm going to go based on up here,\n\nI'm going to say a margin left of four\nM and actually I might even push that up\n\nto a five. Um, and I'm just,\nI'm, I'm eyeballing it.\n\nI'm not measuring the actual spaces here.\n\nIf you were getting a well like\na good design from a designer,\n\nthey'd probably tell you\nexactly what the spacing is,\n\nbut it does look pretty big.\nMaybe I pushed it a bit too much,\n\nbut I think I'm gonna stick with that.\nUm, now if you don't like that, exactly,\n\nyou could also base that as a percentage,\n\nbut I'm just playing around with this\na little bit to see what it's looking\n\nlike. And overall, I am pretty happy\nwith how that spacing does look,\n\nuh, when that first starts and\nhow it's looking here. So overall,\n\nI'm pretty glad with that. And\nI think I'll stick with it.\n\nI guess what we're almost done.\n\nThere's not much else that needs\nto be done when the ECL minimum,\n\nmy immediate queries are. And that's,\nagain, this is a simple site here.\n\nI think what I will do, actually,\n\nit just really fast that's\ncome in and in my main title,\n\nlet's turn the word wrap on for\na second. And where did we do it?\n\nDon't don't we can add a line break here.\n\nDon't hate me. Cause they\ndon't use closing tags\n\nor the closing thing on a self\nclosing tag a, there we go.\n\nSo that's looking alright.\nI'm pretty happy with that.\n\nExcept my font size is too small.\nSo that was one thing. Whoops,\n\nI'm scrolling in the wrong place.\n\nWe did mention that we will\nwant to change that as well.\n\nSo I'm going to do that\njust over here of my intro\n\ntitle. So the font\nsize, now it will become\n\n3.75 REM, which should be 60 pixels.\n\nSo we get the nice big font size there.\nAnd then the font size changes there.\n\nThe NCA clicking over once we\ngo over to the other screen.\n\nSo just like that, everything is\nlooking nice. It's looking good.\n\nIt's working at all the screen\nsizes and we are good to go.\n\nSo another reason I\nlike doing it this way,\n\na mobile first is because what it\ndoes is it keeps all sort of the style\n\nrelated stuff, typography, colors,\nbackgrounds, grouped together.\n\nAnd other than some font size changes,\n\nit keeps all the layout\nstuff grouped together.\n\nAnd I tend to have more\nfont size changes in this.\n\nI'm often changing the body\nfont size a little bit. Um,\n\nwe might go from like a 16 to an 18\nor an 18 to a 21 or things like that.\n\nSo you will tend to have more changes.\n\nI did want to leave it pretty\nsimple for this challenge,\n\ncause I just wanted it\nto focus on, you know,\n\nat the time it was just\ngetting on Flexbox to work.\n\nBut since we've added media queries,\n\nI did want to look at how easily you\ncould do it to get the media queries built\n\ninto it. And if you do want to challenge\nyourself a little bit, you could,\n\nyou know, look at how easy you could\nactually take the file that you made,\n\nthat wasn't responsive and just copy\nand paste a few things down from the top\n\narea into a media query and not\nactually have to write any new code.\n\nYou write your media query,\ncopy paste a few things.\n\nIt's probably gonna work perfectly without\nhaving to do the max with way where\n\nyou're actually overwriting\nother things. So if you want,\n\nyou can give that a try\nin the next video though,\n\nI am going to look at the solution to\nthat little challenge I gave for this top\n\narea right here.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/274380-day-18-challenge-solution-mobile-first/793058-flexbox-challenge-4-solution-adding-media-queries-for-larger-screens?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1888">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uriz8w5tj9","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT4M33S","name":"challenge-02_1.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/788c342219b4fad4c37f697af112a7d3870e8501.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/c0b946944ea3197bf9b5cfc48ded65983e669ffc.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/uriz8w5tj9","uploadDate":"2020-04-30","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"Okay. So in the design file,\n\nwhat I asked you to do is give this\na minimum height and you might go,\n\nbut Kevin, you told us never\nto give things Heights,\n\nso never give them fixed Heights.\n\nI think Heights that can adjust\nto the screen are perfectly fine.\n\nSo on my intro here, what I'm going\nto do is give this a minimum height\n\nof let's give it a thousand\npixels for now just for fun.\n\nAnd that means this area has a\nheight with a thousand pixels,\n\nwhich I will look at matched my screen\nheight almost. I'm just barely off,\n\nbut it's put a height of a thousand\npixels on it, but that's a minimum height.\n\nSo actually let's do a\nminimum height of 10 pixels.\n\nAnd it won't actually be 10 pixels.\nIf I give this a height of 10 pixels,\n\nit will be 10 pixels. So then\nwe get this it's 10 pixels\n\nhas that. I took the\npadding off originally,\n\nbut we have that like generic section\npadding on there. So that's in there. Um,\n\nbut I'm, I hate to have zero pixels\nhere, um, until we have overflow.\n\nSo this stuff is overflowing\nout, but if I do minimum height,\n\nthat's not becoming an issue.\n\nMy minimum height of zero\npixels is actually saying,\n\nI want you to be zero pixels or bigger.\n\nSo because I have more content\ncoming in, it's stretching still.\n\nSo even if I come up to drew\ndrew here and we add more\n\ntext, a whole bunch of\ntexts, just like that, uh,\n\nit's going to grow to fit that\ntext. And we get this big,\n\nlong section that's\ngrowing with what I have.\n\nSo men Heights can actually be quite\nuseful and quite handy if you're wondering\n\nhow I did that, just\nreally fast, actually. Um,\n\nif you're in here in your Loram\nand hit tab, this is part of Emmet.\n\nYou'll get some texts or you could\neven write like Laura a hundred,\n\nwe'll give you a hundred words or one,\nwe'll give you one word, just, you know,\n\na nice little tip for them quickly.\nLet's say you're trying to build\n\nso a minimum height here.\n\nI could do a minimum height of 660 pixels.\n\nI know it wants to be at six\n60, but if I had more content,\n\nit would stretch and it\nwouldn't be an issue.\n\nSo minimum mites I think are fine.\n\nYou'll see them used a lot for these\ntypes of areas at the top here.\n\nBut the only problem with it is\nwhen you do a minimum height,\n\neverything gets stuck to the\ntop. I have some padding here,\n\nbut this is still stuck to the top.\nSo what do we do about that? Hmm,\n\nwell,\n\nwhat we can do is I can use\nwhat we've learned about\n\ncentering stuff,\n\nand I can use a display of flex and\nnothing is going to change it first.\n\nNow, if you went to him and why\ndidn't this and this become columns,\n\nthe intro is display flex that's\nbecause we had a container in there.\n\nSo we have my intro and then a container.\n\nSo my container here is the flex trial.\nSo nothing's really happening. Um, so,\n\nyou know, we only end up with one\ncolumn because we only have one child.\n\nIf we had three or four children in here,\nthen we would have multiple columns.\n\nBut the advantage with display flex,\n\nlike we saw when we did the navigation\nwith our is we get access to something\n\ncalled a line items and we can\ndo a, uh, so just as a reminder,\n\nI can do a flex end and it will go all\nthe way to the bottom minus the padding.\n\nSo it's not touching the very\nbottom or I can do a center\n\nand just like that, it's\nperfectly centered vertically.\n\nSo a nice way that you can add a\nheight on something and you could match\n\nthe actual height to your viewport\nby using 100 VH. And look at that,\n\nit will match the height of viewport\nas a minimum cool thing with this is if\n\nyour viewport is smaller, it's\nstill matching the height of it.\n\nSo if you're on a small device,\nyou will match the height.\n\nOr if you're on a big device,\nit will also match the height.\n\nNow there are some issues with this on\nSafari. And so that means iOS devices.\n\nSo just do know that it might not be a\nhundred percent perfect or what you're\n\nexpecting, but, but for the most\npart, they will work pretty well.\n\nAnd so that could be a nice way to get\nsomething like that, knowing this layout.\n\nI don't think I would use it. Um,\n\nso let's bring that back to what\nI had asked for at the six 60. Um,\n\nand there we go. So it's at six\n60 and I can see what I want,\n\nbut even if it's on a smaller device,\neverything will be fine. We scroll down,\n\nwe get to the next parts that\nwe need to get to. So a nice,\n\ncool trick with a minimum height\nand then using Flexbox to center it.\n\nAnd I just realized, I said, B\nas if everyone knows what it is,\n\nI did link to it and one of the days\noff, but in case you didn't watch it,\n\nand you're curious about it.\n\nI'll put a link to it in the\ndescription of this video as well.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/274380-day-18-challenge-solution-mobile-first/793042-flexbox-challenge-4-solution-a-look-at-min-height?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1944">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/fr2nw6bzv8","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT4M34S","name":"2020-04-30 21-17-05.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/945b5f43b45272dda40c148d66e4b679c07e5df1.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/f12903339e9ecbce06449cbd50bbbe2b1890a4c6.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/fr2nw6bzv8","uploadDate":"2020-04-30","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"All right. So we're approaching the\nend of conquering responsive layouts,\n\nbut we are not done it yet.\n\nThis is the second to last challenge\nthat we are going to be doing.\n\nThere'll be one other one after\nthis, but before we worry about that,\n\nwe have this one to tackle.\nSo this is the layout.\n\nI'm going to provide this for you. It\ndoes not need to match this exactly,\n\nbut we're going to build a mobile\nnavigation. Now for this course,\n\nit has been put together\nas responsive layouts.\n\nSo I am providing you with\nsome of the pieces to do this.\n\nSo I will be looking at that in this\nvideo and what exactly you have to do.\n\nAnd I will be providing a PDF like\nusual of what the layout should be\n\nwith the layout should look like.\n\nAnd it will have a bit of more\nexplanation in there as well.\n\nSo this is what you're\ngoing to be starting with.\n\nYou can see didn't have vacation is\ncompletely gotten. It has vanished. Um,\n\nI'll fix that for you. Um, toggle, uh,\n\nI'm just going to come here\nand I'm going to do a nav of\n\ndisplay flex, and I'll be nice cause\nwe do need to display flex on there.\n\nSo I'm gonna start it off there\ninstead of putting that to block,\n\nbecause if I did display block,\n\nI think a few people would\nget a bit stuck on that.\n\nSo this will have to be a display\nflex and you can see it's come in. Um,\n\nso you can see I've taken\nall the styling away from it.\n\nSo you will have to restyle it.\n\nNow you can go back to the previous\nlessons and copy and paste things,\n\nof course,\n\nbut I'd like you to try and do it on\nyour own because that is the best way to\n\nlearn and make sure you\nreally understand it.\n\nIf you did it before and you watch\nme do it and you understood it,\n\nit should not take you long\nto do. And if you get stuck,\n\nit means that well now you know where\nthere's a few things you get stuck on.\n\nYou can go back to a previous\nvideo and figure them out. Um,\n\nthe reason I've taken all\nthe styling away though,\n\nis because we're going to\nhave the menu working here.\n\nAnd I want to reinforce a little bit\nof the mobile first thing that we've\n\ncreated or that I've talked about. I've\nsaid mobile first works really well.\n\nAnd you can see here, we have our list,\n\nbut you won't have to do a lot of styling\non the list to get it to work mobile\n\nfirst, even though I've taken the time\nto make this work and be functional,\n\nnothing too complicated to do\nthat. Um, so when we click that,\n\nwe want it to look good. And then\nwhen we get to the big sizes,\n\nwe want it to look good is here. So\nthat just means in the media query,\n\nwe're working for what it looks like here.\n\nAnd when we're not in the media\nquery, we are going to be up here.\n\nNow I have deleted\neverything that was up here.\n\nSo there's not a lot that you can. Yeah.\n\nSo you will have to rewrite all\nthe selectors and do all that,\n\nbut it shouldn't be too bad. Um, if you\nwill have to use my class names though,\n\num, one thing you will notice,\nit's a little different.\n\nHere's the NAB display none and in nav\nvisible and it has the display block on\n\nit. So that's just because\nI have a button here.\n\nAnd when we click that button right there,\n\nall that's doing is if we\nlook here at my JavaScript,\n\nlet's make that a little bigger. Um,\nwe're just going on the nav toggle.\n\nAnd whenever we click on it, we're\nturning the nav visible class on and off.\n\nSo that just means that my\nnavigation itself goes from a\n\ndisplay of none to a display of\nblock. So it disappears and comes in.\n\nSo a nice, simple way to do it. Um,\nthere are lots of other ways to do this,\n\nbut I didn't want to get too complicated\nin how the navigation's working.\n\nI really want to focus solely on styling\nit and getting it to look the way we\n\nwant it to at both the small\nand the big screen sizes.\n\nSo that is your challenge for this video,\n\nas far as what it looks like at\nthe large screen sizes, that is,\n\nthat is your choice. Um, if you want to\ndo it with the navigation in the middle,\n\nand then the two buttons\non the side you can,\n\nor if you prefer everything\ngrouped over on the right side,\n\nyou can also do that. You can\nstyle it however you want,\n\nbut for the small screen sizes, we\ndo want to stick with something.\n\nThat's going to look a\nlittle bit like this.\n\nIt doesn't have to be exactly the same,\n\nbut something a little bit like\nthis should be looking pretty good.\n\nI know it can be a little bit difficult\nwhen you're using somebody else's code\n\ninstead of your own. Um,\n\nso some people might want to\njust rewrite things from scratch,\n\nbut it is a really good skill to be\nable to look at someone else's code and\n\nfigure it out.\n\nCause that's the real world you're\ngoing to be running into that a lot. Uh,\n\nwhen you're in the real world,\nwhether you're modifying themes,\n\nwhether you're working\nwith teams of other people,\n\nyou're not going to be walking into\nprojects and always writing things from\n\nscratch. If anything, you'll be\ndoing that the least amount of time.\n\nSo do take the time to try and figure\nthis out and see how you can do it within\n\nan existing code base. Even if it\ndoes seem a little bit challenging.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/275774-day-19-mobile-navigation-challenge/796918-navigation-challenge?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_1997">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/rligq0k0qt","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT9M38S","name":"nav-challenge-again_1.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/9db02db5ef1ae61028ac3726b97e1477880216be.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/94fd045e0e7162b7813e34c5db8412111f0af868.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/rligq0k0qt","uploadDate":"2020-05-02","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"So the very first thing I'm gonna say is\nif you downloaded this challenge as one\n\nof the early people to do it,\n\nyou might have been missing a little\nbit of stuff in the media query.\n\nSo I didn't have the visibility of\nvisible or the height of auto here. Um,\n\nand I apologize for that,\n\nbecause what that would mean is when\nyou're at the small screen sizes, um,\n\ndepending if this was open or closed,\n\nyou would actually have different\nresults here at the big screen.\n\nSo if you got a little bit stuck on that,\nI do apologize if that was the case.\n\nAnd you got frustrated and stopped knowing\nthat maybe add this to your CSS and\n\nsee if you can finish the challenge. Now,\n\nif you came to the challenge after I\nupdated my files and included this,\n\nthen ignore what I just said, and\nwe can keep on going from here.\n\nSo the very first name new is not\neven worried about my media query.\n\nI'm just going to come up to here,\n\nwhere I had my nap by my\nnap toggle and all of that.\n\nAnd we'll come after all of this styling.\nUm, and you're even said, you know,\n\nfrom when I recorded yesterday's video,\n\nI did make a couple of\nlittle changes here.\n\nSo pretty much what I was doing in the\nmedia query for when the navigation is\n\nopened is I was including, uh,\n\nwhat you can see here to make sure\nthat it wouldn't run into any issues.\n\nOne thing I did not do is include\nthe position of relatives.\n\nSo we'll see if that causes us any\nproblems and we can fix that one. Um,\n\nso I'm going to shrink this down. So at\nthe small screen sizes, cause I said,\n\nwe should be doing it mobile first and\nwe don't see it. And when we click that,\n\nit opens up and this is what I\nwant to worry about at first.\n\nSo the first thing we do is\ncome on my nav list and do a\n\nmargin of zero heading\nzero and list style of\n\nnone to get rid of all of\nthat stuff and right away,\n\njust by doing that things start\ncoming together. And you know,\n\nwe're not far off where we'd\nprobably want to be. Um,\n\nso you can see one of the reasons I\nlike mobile first, a lot of the time,\n\nthis is what I find ends up happening.\nI'm going to go onto my nav,\n\nuh, items. So that's the\nlist, item, the allies.\n\nAnd we'll give them a\nlittle margin top on these,\n\njust to space things out a little bit.\n\nI'll try to 0.5 M and actually I\nthink my font size is a little big.\n\nSo on the nav itself,\n\nand you could do this on the nav item\nor the nav link or wherever you want,\n\nbut I'm going to do it here\nor I'm gonna put a font size.\n\nI think we dropped it to\na 0.5, a REM originally,\n\nwhich maybe that's a bit\nsmall. We'll go with one REM.\n\nI think that will work out fine\nright now. So that's looking alright.\n\nSo we have our margin spacing things out.\n\nMaybe that could even be a tab a\nlittle bit bigger. There we go. Um,\n\nthat's my neck item. So\nthere it's spacing out.\n\nAnd then on my nav link,\n\nI'm going to come and styles things. Now,\n\nif you tried putting the merchant top\non the nav link and it didn't work it's\n\nbecause the links by default are inline\nitems. So margin top and bottom will,\n\nwill not work on them.\n\nSo that's why I popped up over\nto here to do it on here though.\n\nIt's all the typography stuff. So we\nwant to do the color of white or FFF.\n\nWe want to do the, a,\n\nwe can do a text transform\nof upper case, uh,\n\nget rid of the text decoration,\ntext declaration of none.\n\nAnd that's starting to look pretty good.\nWe should probably have a hover and a,\n\num, focus state. So however,\n\nand the focus and we'll just do,\n\nlike I've been doing up until now\nwith an old pass capacity of like a\n\n0.75, I think is what I've\nbeen using up until now.\n\nIf you don't find it's enough, we can\nalways bring that up to like a 0.6,\n\nfive or something. So\nthen if I tap through,\n\nyou can see that it's highlighting\nit as well. So there we go. Uh,\n\nI think that's looking pretty good.\n\nWe just need to get that extra\nlittle space right there.\n\nSo that would be my nav.\n\nYou could either do this as a margin\ntop on the secondary or as the margin\n\nbottom on the primary. So I'm\ngoing to do that. If my nav list,\n\nuh, primary can have a\nmargin top of, to em,\n\nI think will be a, what margin bottom\ntop is in the wrong spot. There we go.\n\nAnd it adds the space right there and\nvery quickly, uh, while we're here,\n\nwe can go on my nav link a\nbutton and we can make that look\n\na little bit like our\nbutton that we had before.\n\nSo we want some padding of 0.2,\n\n5.705 M a background of\n\nwhite oops,\n\nand a color. And I don't\nknow which color was,\n\nwe'll probably go with the same one\nwe had there. And of course, a border\n\nradius of, I think we just did\na hundred pixels last time.\n\nSo it might as well stick with\nthe same thing. There we go.\n\nI think that looks perfect. Um,\n\nand we're getting that same\nopacity type of thing going on it,\n\nso even we don't have to come up\nwith its own style for that. Uh,\n\none thing I'm going to do is I\nput my nav list primary here.\n\nI'm going to move that up just so\nit's grouped with my main nav list,\n\njust because I think that makes a\nbit more sense for organizing my CSS.\n\nAnd I think at this screen size, that's\nlooking exactly how I wanted it to look.\n\nSo I'm pretty happy with\nthat. It's looking good.\n\nAnd then when we get to this one,\nwell, stuff sort of falls apart.\n\nSo we need to fix all of that when\nwe get to the large screen sizes,\n\nbut here at the small ones,\nwe're good to go and in, see,\n\nI didn't really do much layout stuff.\n\nWe have a couple of margins adding a\nlittle bit of space, but other than that,\n\nit's all just,\n\nit's all the very basics of removing\nour list style and that's about it.\n\nSo that's one of the reasons,\nagain, I like doing mobile first,\n\neven though there is the complexity of\nhaving to have a drop down menu, um,\n\nonce you're past that or\nlike a hidden navigation,\n\nonce you get past that complexity of it,\n\nlayered wise of how you're doing your\ncontent, it's usually much simpler.\n\nAnd then once we come into\nour media query here, now,\n\nthings might get a\nlittle bit more complex.\n\nSo let's increase my screen size\nand see what we can do with it. And,\n\num, so we want to do a couple\nof things I'm going to do.\n\nMy nav list is going to\nbecome a display of flex.\n\nSo that should get everything next to\none another. That's a decent start. Um,\n\nwe also added a margin to\nmy I'm going to make sure\n\nI'm just going to put margin\nof zero on that. So I don't,\n\nwe had a margin on one of my lists,\n\nso that should remove the\nmargin on one of my lists.\n\nAnd we also had the nav items,\nwhich we had a margin on.\n\nSo I want to get rid of that margin\nas well. So we can do a zero on that.\n\nYou can see that margin has also\ndisappeared. Um, on the nav itself,\n\nwe have a display of flex.\n\nSo here I can also come\nin and do a, uh, like, um,\n\nalign items center, which I think\nthere we go into the center,\n\nit more within the logo.\nNow it's all working now.\n\nAnd that's when this is visible.\n\nI'm just worried if I hide that the\npositioning of things might be a little\n\ndifferent. So, you know,\nnow it's overlapping your,\n\nmy logo and that's because we,\n\nif we come all the way back up in my CSS,\n\num, Juju that's where here\nI'd had the position absolute,\n\nthere was turning into a position\nrelative. So if you got caught up on that,\n\nI do apologize,\n\nbut it's one of those things that is a\ngood thing to learn how to troubleshoot.\n\nUm, so here, it just\nmeans on the nav itself,\n\nwe want to put that back to\na position of a relative and\n\nthen whether this is\nopen and we look at it\n\nor whether it's closed and we look at\nit, we're not running into any issues.\n\nThey're exactly the same now. So\nstill working inside my media query,\n\nwhat I'm going to do, we\nhave my nav item. Uh, we can,\n\nI'm actually trying to think.\nUm, so on the navigation itself,\n\nI'm going to go with a\nbit more of a simple one.\n\nI think what I'm going to do is, um,\n\nI think what we can do here\nis just do a justify content\n\nflex end, which would push\neverything over to the other end.\n\nAnd then we can just space out all of\nour items. So here have a margin of zero,\n\nbut we could do like a zero\ntop zero, right, zero bottom,\n\nand say to em from two, I might be a bit\nbig. Let's see maybe a little bit big.\n\nWe'll do like a 1.5 M um, and\nthen we can space it out that way.\n\nNow if you want, and you prefer\nthat being in the center,\n\nyou can use that same trick that\nwe've looked at before with the nav\n\nlist, primary covering\nthe margin of zero auto.\n\nAnd that's still going\nto work in this case. Um,\n\nyou might have to play around a\nlittle bit with your margins though,\n\njust cause I think one of the sizes, like,\n\nI don't think it's perfectly centered,\nuh, with this right now. So, um,\n\nand I'm just because we haven't\nreally looked at this pattern yet.\n\nI'm going to stick with this one where\nwe get the logo there and all the other\n\nthings over on this side and\njust like that we are all done.\n\nSo there you have it, there's the,\n\nI apologize if you got stuck along with\nany of the little things along the way,\n\nbut if you manage to solve\nthem really, really good job,\n\nif you do get stuck and there\nwas something that was, you know,\n\none of these little more tricky type of\nthings that was getting in your way by\n\nall means, go ahead and try\nand do it on your own. Now,\n\ninstead of just watching me do it,\n\nit's one thing to watch me do\nit and then to be like, Oh yeah,\n\nthat does make sense.\n\nIt's another to now go ahead and do it\nyourself and make sure that it's actually\n\nworking and that you can get it to work\nwithout coming back and looking at it.\n\nAnd of course, if it's still not working,\n\nthen you can come back and triple check.\nSo there's no harm in that at all.\n\nAnd I'd really encourage you to do that.\n\nIf you had any trouble with this one\nto go back through and give it another,\n\ntry.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/277099-day-20-mobile-navigation-challenge-solution/800799-navigation-challenge-my-solution?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><script class="w-json-ld" type="application/ld+json" id="w-json-ldwistia_2050">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@id":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ri7q5p1x3v","@type":"VideoObject","duration":"PT10M47S","name":"end-end.mp4","thumbnailUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/4d476f3dd41b70912f128e63991b5b588931ce03.jpg?image_crop_resized=960x540","contentUrl":"https://embed-ssl.wistia.com/deliveries/c29515c4b86968bdb15d8917d4e44738573ffc7e.m3u8","embedUrl":"https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ri7q5p1x3v","uploadDate":"2020-05-02","description":"a Coach Uploads video","transcript":"You have done it. You have made\nit to the end of this course.\n\nWe've done 21 days of\nconquering responsive websites,\n\nand you should be super proud of\nyourself for making it this far.\n\nNot everyone is going to make\nit all the way here to the end.\n\nSo you should be super,\n\nsuper proud of yourself for getting all\nthe way through here. And in this video,\n\nwe're going to be doing a bit of a recap\nof what we've learned so far and also\n\nwhat's next and where you\nshould be going from here.\n\nSo just as a quick recap,\n\none of the early things that we learned\nis that websites are responsive before\n\nwe write any CSS. When the\nlayouts run into issues,\n\nwe are the ones at fault.\n\nWe have done something in our own CSS\nthat has caused a problem to happen\n\nusually. And I'm not going to say always,\n\nbut usually a desktop first approach\nis the culprit to these issues.\n\nWe do something for large screen sizes.\nAnd then when we shrink things down,\n\nthose layout decisions that we made,\n\nthey're the things that\nare getting in the way,\n\nand we have to start overwriting things.\n\nSo writing mobile first CSS tends\nto be the easier way to approach it.\n\nEven if we only have a desktop\nlayout to base things off of.\n\nAnd that's often something\nthat people tell me, they say,\n\none of the reasons they rate desktop\nversus that's all they get from their\n\ndesigner personally. I don't\nthink that is an excuse.\n\nSo just as a very quick look here at how\nwe could do things two different ways\n\nand how we're often overwriting things\nis the desktop first approach. You know,\n\nwe set everything up and then we\ngo into our media query and the max\n\nwidth, and, and then we're stuck over\nwriting things for the small screens.\n\nWhereas if we only put in\nthat display flex and the wits\n\ninside a media query for\nthat exact same purpose,\n\nwe wouldn't even have to write anything\noutside the media query because\n\neverything would just work. Anyway,\nin the example, on the left there,\n\neverything that you see is just resetting\nthings back to the default that they\n\nalready were. And as we've\nseen a few times now,\n\nif we start just by writing things with\nthe general layout in term with your\n\nfonts, your colors and your spacing, and\nthat's it outside of immediate query,\n\nthe mobile layout does a lot of\nprogress. We get really far with it.\n\nAnd then we can come into\nour media queries and start\nadding things like display\n\nflex, adding in wits, getting\nthings into more complex modes.\n\nAnd that way we don't run into any issues.\n\nWe add complexity as\nour screen gets bigger.\n\nWe've also looked at the basics of\nFlexbox, but I won't lie to you.\n\nThere is a lot more to it that I\nhave not covered in this course.\n\nAnd one of the things I really\nlike about Flexbox though,\n\nis that you can do that. You can start\nby learning the very basics of it.\n\nYou can get things working, and then as\nyou run into more complex situations,\n\nyou can start learning a little bit more\nabout Flexbox and adding in the extra\n\nthings that it can do,\n\nbut you don't need to know everything\nabout Flexbox to get it, to work.\n\nJust like you don't\nneed to know everything.\n\nThere is about CSS to change the color\nof your text or something like that.\n\none of the things that you might've\nheard about other than Flexbox as well is\n\ngrid, but I don't want you to rush things.\n\nThere's a lot more to\nFlexbox. There is grid.\n\nOne of the reasons I decided not to\ntouch on grid in this course is because\n\nthere is so much to grid.\nIt is massive. It's huge.\n\nAnd it tends to be a little bit\nmore complex that said, I love it.\n\nIt's one of my favorite things. That's\nhappened to CSS in a really long time.\n\nIt's super exciting, super fun.\n\nBut if you're not comfortable with what\nyou already know, do not rush things,\n\nmastering anything. Isn't about\nlearning as much as you possibly can,\n\nespecially as fast as you possibly can.\nThe faster you try and learn everything,\n\nthe less you're actually going to retain.\n\nThat's one of the reasons I did\nthis course in the way I did it,\n\nwhere we went through\neverything slowly over 21 days,\n\nwe could have crammed all of\nthese lessons in super quickly.\n\nWe could have tried to plow\nthrough it as fast as we could,\n\nand probably done it in\na quarter of the time,\n\nbut people wouldn't be retaining\nwhat we were learning along the way.\n\nYou wouldn't be practicing as much.\n\nAnd you wouldn't just be taking a break\nand doing something else which really\n\ndoes help you retain the information.\n\nI want you to practice\nwhat you've learned here.\n\nEven if you feel comfortable with it,\n\nI want you to practice what you've\nlearned here before you do anything else.\n\nAnd then slowly add on top, learn\nsomething new, learn it really well,\n\nbe comfortable with it and then go\nonto the next step. So what is that?\n\nWhat is that next step? Well, I'm\nnot going to leave you empty handed.\n\nI don't want to just be\nlike, Oh, you've done it all.\n\nYou're probably going well at that\nlast challenge we did was okay. But,\n\nyou know, I don't feel like I've really\npracticed everything we've learned.\n\nSo I am giving you this.\nThis is the next, the final,\n\nthe last challenge that you will\nbe doing as part of this course,\n\nI am giving you this. I will be giving\nyou a lot more specifications to it.\n\nThere are requirements for\nwhere the break points will be.\n\nYou're going to have to\nbreak points for this one.\n\nCause we're going to do something a little\nbit more interesting here where it's\n\nsmall screen sizes, all stacks.\nThen at the next screen size,\n\nthese turned into three columns,\n\nbut they stay underneath because there's\nnot enough room. And then finally, uh,\n\nit will become, and then finally\nat the largest screen size,\n\nthey will come into a two column\nlayout to just like this. Um,\n\nit's a lot of things we've already\nlooked at and already learned,\n\nbut we're changing things up a little bit.\n\nWe're trying to make it look a little\nbit nicer. Um, and as you can see,\n\nwe're updating the\ncomplexity a little bit.\n\nSo that bottom area we can add in a\nlittle bit of extra there that we haven't\n\nreally looked at,\n\nbut I think you'll figure out how to do\nit based on everything we've learned so\n\nfar. And once you finish this, you've\ngot through it. You're confident with it.\n\nOf course go over under the discord,\ngoing to the solutions and post it and,\n\nand see what other people are up to\nthere as well. So you can do with it. Um,\n\nand how far you can get, if you get\nstuck, the discord is there for you.\n\nThis one, I will not be\nposting a solution for,\n\nunless a lot of you guys\nreally asked me for it.\n\nAnd then maybe I'll think about it, but\nit will not be ready for you right away.\n\nI want to make sure that everybody\nhas the time they need to work on this\n\nwithout posting a solution.\nSo maybe in a week from now,\n\nyou might be lucky to get one, but\nwe'll see. I don't think you need it.\n\nBut if everybody asks me for one, maybe\nI will include one. Um, and after that,\n\nwell, that's up to you. Different people\nare going to be at different stages.\n\nSome people are coming here from a\nJavaScript background and they just are\n\nreally frustrated with responsive design.\n\nOther people are just starting\nto learn HTML and CSS.\n\nThis was part of their\njourney along the way.\n\nSo where you're going next after\nthis is completely up to you.\n\nBut of course I do have some\nsuggestions to help you out.\n\nSo if you like my style of things\nand you didn't already know,\n\nI do have a YouTube channel where I\ncover HTML and CSS and do a lot of CSS\n\ncontent generally.\n\nAnd I will be also doing a lot more\ndesigned content on my YouTube channel as\n\nwell. But CSS will always\nbe the focus of my channel.\n\nSo if you like my stuff there\nand you like free content,\n\nthat is a great place to go. I do also\nhave a free HTML and CSS crash course.\n\nThis is hosted on [inaudible], uh,\n\nit's about four hours long and\nit's assuming it starts from zero.\n\nSo you're really going from,\nI don't know any HTML NCSS,\n\nand you work your way up to an\nintroduction to Flexbox. It's even a very,\n\nvery simple one.\n\nBut if you feel that you want to get more\nof a solid foundation in your HTML and\n\nCSS, that could be a\nvery nice place to start.\n\nIf you're past that stage and you\nwant to up your game a little bit,\n\nI do also onscreen by have the\nresponsive web design boot camp.\n\nIt is a premium course.\nIt is over 15 hours long,\n\nand I am currently working on\na new module for that course.\n\nIt will be something that gets updated.\n\nSo it might be approaching 16\nto 17 hours in length soon,\n\nuh, which is a lot of content.\nIt really goes over everything.\n\nIt continues off from where the crash\ncourse leaves off pretty much so it's,\n\nit goes into Flexbox in a lot of detail,\n\nit really goes through a lot of\nthe properties and how it works.\n\nIt also goes just into CSS, designing CSS,\n\nunderstanding some basic design\nfundamentals and things like that,\n\nas well as going into grid.\n\nIt does take a bit of a deep\ndive into CSS grid as well.\n\nSo it is a much more comprehensive\ncourse. It is a premium course.\n\nSo if you do want to support me,\nthat is one way you can do it.\n\nCause I do get to some of\nthe earnings from that.\n\nAnd if you look at the price and\nit's a bit high, it is often on sale.\n\nSo you could wait for a sale to come\naround and before you purchase it,\n\nif that is something that you are\ninterested in other resources though,\n\nI'm not the only one who's creating\ncontent, uh, out there. So, um,\n\nif you aren't interested in grid and\nyou really just want to get into grid,\n\nthere is CSS grid.io. This is\na free course by West boss.\n\nWest is a very awesome\ncontent creator and educator.\n\nAnd so that's one of his courses.\n\nYou could also just look at West boss\nand he has a lot of mostly JavaScript\n\ncontent. Um, but that is a free\ncourse that he does offer on CSS grid.\n\nSo it could be a good place\nto look. If you just like,\n\nif you just feel like practicing what\nyou've learned so far or trying to push\n\nyourself a little bit more,\nthere is front end, mentor.io.\n\nThey do have free content\nas well as paid content,\n\nbut they supply you with designs.\nCause I know as developers often,\n\none of the things that is the hardest\nto do is come up with a nice looking\n\ndesigns to base their stuff off of. So\nthey have really nice looking stuff. Um,\n\nthey've done a really nice job\nin putting together projects.\n\nThey're not sponsoring\nme to say anything here.\n\nI just think it is a really nice resource\nfor people that are trying to up their\n\nfront end game and not\nhave to worry about design,\n\nbut have really nice designs and\nthey have different skill levels, uh,\n\nfor their challenges. So I really\nrecommend checking those guys out. Uh,\n\nif you don't know about free code camp,\nfree code camp is an amazing resource.\n\nSo I definitely would\ncheck them out as well. Uh,\n\nthey do HTML CSS and go into JavaScript\nand react and view and everything you\n\ncan think of.\n\nSo definitely something that could be\nvery interesting to look into as time goes\n\non and as their name implies,\nall of their content is free.\n\nThere are also tons of amazing YouTube\neducators that are out there and\n\nobviously their content is on\nYouTube. It is completely free.\n\nSo what I'm going to do is I don't want\nto list them all out in this slide. Um,\n\nso I'm just going to put all of everything\nI've talked about here will be any\n\nlink down below.\n\nSo I'm just going to include a whole\nbunch of creators that I know of that do\n\nreally nice stuff and the type of\ncontent you can find in their channel.\n\nSo it'll all be linked either\nafter this video or I might do, um,\n\nlike a text post after this one that has\nall of these resources to make it easy\n\nfor people to find later on.\nSo I'll probably do that,\n\nnot in the description of this\nvideo, but in the video after this,\n\nyou'll have the whole list of everything\nhere and the links to all of it.\n\nSo once again, you have wrapped\nthis up, you have finished it.\n\nOther than that challenge, you, you\ndefinitely go and do that challenge.\n\nI want to see you guys\nposting the solutions to that\nover on the discord or over\n\non Twitter or over on Instagram.\nLet me see those solutions.\n\nI love to reshare them if they're on\nsocial media and see how awesome and see\n\nhow you have managed to knock those out\nof the park after getting through this\n\ncourse, be very, very happy, very,\n\nvery proud of the fact that\nyou've made it this far.\n\nAnd I really look forward to continuing\nto hang out with you in the discord.\n\nSo even though this course is wrapped up,\n\nall of this content will\nforever be available for you.\n\nThat discord will always be there and\nI'm always going to be in there when I\n\nhave the time to jump in. So I really\nlook forward to seeing you there.\n\nI look forward to seeing over on my\nYouTube channel, hopefully keep on going,\n\nkeep on pushing yourself. You are\ngoing to create some amazing things.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/278049-day-21-you-ve-done-it/803464-you-ve-done-it?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script><style type="text/css" data-tag-name="trix-editor">trix-editor {
